/**
 * db.ts — D1 database access helpers for read replication and sharding readiness.

 * instead of the primary writer, reducing contention during agent mesh runs.
 *
 * These helpers are also the sharding integration point for Phase 0.7+.
 * When per-tenant database sharding ships, only the implementations here
 * change — call sites in handlers do not need to be updated again.
