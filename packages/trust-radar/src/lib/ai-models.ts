/**
 * Canonical model constants for trust-radar AI call sites.
 * Change HOT_PATH_HAIKU here to update every non-ARCHITECT AI call at once.
 *
 * Cost reference (per 1M tokens, input / output):
 *   claude-haiku-4-5-20251001   $1.00 / $5.00   (current — only available Haiku as of April 2026)
 *
 * Retired models (DO NOT USE — Anthropic returns errors / hangs):
 *   claude-haiku-3-5-20241022   RETIRED 2026-02-19
 *   claude-3-haiku-20240307     RETIRED 2026-02-19
 *
 * History: this constant briefly held the retired claude-3-haiku-20240307
 * during a deprecation grace period when Anthropic was silently routing
 * the retired model ID to Haiku 4.5. The grace period stopped functioning
 * in production around 2026-04-10 12:25 UTC, breaking every wrapper-based
 * Haiku call. Reverted to claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 the same day.
