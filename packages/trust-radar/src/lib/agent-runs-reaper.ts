// agent_runs Orphan Reaper
//
// `agentRunner.executeAgent` inserts an `agent_runs` row with
// `status='partial'` before invoking the agent's execute(), then
// flips it to 'success' or 'failed' inside a try/catch. If the worker
// is killed mid-run — CPU ceiling, subrequest ceiling, wall-clock
// timeout — the JS try/catch never resolves, the row stays at
// `partial` with `completed_at IS NULL` forever.
//
// The diagnostic endpoint already SURFACES these as `killed_runs`
// (status='partial' AND completed_at IS NULL after the stall window)
// but doesn't act on them. Without a reaper, dead rows never receive
// a final status and the agent's circuit-breaker counter doesn't
// advance — so a chronically-killed agent can stay invisible to the
// stall recovery path.
//
// Mirrors `feed-pull-reaper.ts` line for line — same architectural
// pattern: navigator runs every 5 min, owns the sweep, never throws,
// returns row count for diagnostic surfaces.
//
// Threshold: 15 min. Cloudflare paid-plan Workers have a 15-min
// wall-clock cap (waitUntil included), so any row older than that
// CANNOT still be running. Matches feed-pull-reaper for consistency.
//
// Tested via `test/agent-runs-reaper.test.ts`.
