/**
 * Auto-seeder planter — synthesizes new spam-trap addresses and reads
 * the active roster for the public honeypot pages.
 *
 * Design:
 *   The /admin-portal and /internal-staff pages on averrow.com are
 *   crawler bait — bots scraping disallowed paths (per robots.txt)
 *   harvest the email addresses listed there and feed them into spam
 *   campaigns. Historically the listed addresses were hardcoded in
 *   the template (7 total, never rotated), which is why 96 of 101
 *   seeded addresses had never caught anything (PR #873 investigation).
 *
 *   This module flips that: addresses live in seed_addresses, and the
 *   page renders the latest active set. The auto-seeder agent adds
 *   ~6 fresh addresses per page every Sunday, so a harvester that
 *   scrapes us in week 4 sees a different set than one in week 1.
 *   Address volume grows linearly: ~12 addresses/week × 52 = ~600
 *   per year. Plenty of trap surface even before external posting.
 *
 *   "Realistic" address synthesis: first.last@<domain> for employee
 *   channel, drawn from the same FIRST/LAST/TITLE name pools the
 *   honeypot-generator already uses. Every address is unique because
 *   we suffix a short cohort id (yyMMdd of seed week) when the raw
 *   first.last collides — keeps the address looking realistic without
 *   hp-style numeric suffixes that smart spammers might pattern-match.
