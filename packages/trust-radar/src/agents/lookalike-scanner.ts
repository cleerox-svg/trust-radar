/**
 * Lookalike Scanner — scheduled agent (not synchronous) that checks
 * newly-registered lookalike-domain candidates from the typosquat
 * generator, runs DNS/HTTP/MX checks + a Haiku AI assessment, and
 * stores the results.
 *
 * Phase 3.8 of agent audit. The audit (§5) initially categorised
 * this as a sync candidate; on closer read it's cron-driven (via
 * runLookalikeDomainCheck in orchestrator.ts → handleScheduled
 * hourly tick), not handler-driven. Belongs to the scheduled class.
 *
 * Wraps the existing checkLookalikeBatch(env) function in scanners/
 * lookalike-domains.ts. Per-row AI calls remain inside that
 * function and stay attributed to 'lookalike_scanner' in
 * budget_ledger. ONE agent_runs row per hourly tick covers all
 * rows scanned that tick.
