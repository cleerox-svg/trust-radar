<article class="blog-post-body">

<p>I spent years working inside enterprise identity and digital trust platforms &mdash; the kind that handle authentication for thousands of global organizations. You see everything from that vantage point: how Fortune 500 companies manage access, how mid-market companies try to keep up, and where the gaps are that nobody&rsquo;s watching.</p>

<p>The biggest gap I kept seeing wasn&rsquo;t in network security or endpoint protection. It was in email authentication. Organizations would invest heavily in SSO, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust architecture &mdash; all the right things &mdash; while leaving their email domain completely open to impersonation.</p>

<p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are the protocols that determine whether an attacker can send email that genuinely appears to come from your domain. Not a lookalike domain. Your actual domain, with your brand name in the &ldquo;From&rdquo; field, landing in your customers&rsquo; inboxes. When these are misconfigured or absent &mdash; and they usually are &mdash; it&rsquo;s open season.</p>

<p>The numbers confirm what I saw firsthand. A 2025 analysis by Red Sift across more than 73 million domains found that roughly 84% have no DMARC record at all. Only about 2.5% enforce the strictest &ldquo;reject&rdquo; policy that actually blocks spoofed messages. EasyDMARC&rsquo;s global adoption report confirmed the trend: even among the top 1.8 million domains worldwide, over 80% either lack DMARC entirely or run a non-enforcing policy that&rsquo;s essentially decorative.</p>

<p>The vast majority of domains on the internet can be impersonated via email with virtually no friction. If you&rsquo;ve worked in identity and access management, you know how absurd that is &mdash; it&rsquo;s the equivalent of deploying SSO for your applications while leaving the front door of the building unlocked.</p>

<h3>A Quick Primer on What These Protocols Do</h3>

<p>For those who haven&rsquo;t spent their weekends reading DNS records, here&rsquo;s the short version:</p>

<p><strong>SPF</strong> publishes a list of servers authorized to send email for your domain. If a message comes from an IP not on the list, it fails the check.</p>

<p><strong>DKIM</strong> attaches a cryptographic signature to your outgoing email. The receiving server verifies it against a public key in your DNS. This confirms the message is authentic and hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with in transit.</p>

<p><strong>DMARC</strong> ties SPF and DKIM together and adds a policy &mdash; it tells receiving mail servers what to do when a message fails authentication. Monitor it, quarantine it, or reject it outright.</p>

<p>When all three are properly configured and enforced, spoofing your domain via email goes from trivial to extremely difficult. When they&rsquo;re not &mdash; and for 80%+ of domains, they&rsquo;re not &mdash; an attacker doesn&rsquo;t even need a lookalike domain. They can impersonate you directly.</p>

<h3>The Blind Spot in Brand Protection</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what genuinely surprised me when we built Averrow: none of the major brand protection platforms analyze email authentication as part of their monitoring. Not one.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll detect a phishing URL. They&rsquo;ll flag a fake social media account. They&rsquo;ll find your brand name on a dark web forum. But they won&rsquo;t tell you that your DKIM is half-configured and your DMARC policy is set to &ldquo;none&rdquo; &mdash; which means every one of those other threats is significantly more dangerous than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Having worked on platforms where authentication was the core product, this gap was impossible to ignore. Email authentication is identity verification for your domain. If you can&rsquo;t prove that an email came from you, you can&rsquo;t prove that one didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we built email security posture analysis into the core of Averrow. We check SPF validity, verify DKIM across multiple enterprise email security selectors, assess DMARC policy enforcement, and detect your MX provider. We grade the whole picture from A+ to F and track it over time.</p>

<h3>Why This Hits Mid-Market Companies Hardest</h3>

<p>The FBI&rsquo;s IC3 reported $2.77 billion in business email compromise losses across 21,442 incidents in 2024. That was second only to investment fraud in total dollar losses, and those are just the reported cases.</p>

<p>From my experience working with enterprise customers globally, the large organizations generally have this covered &mdash; they have security teams that enforce authentication standards. The mid-market is where the risk concentrates. These companies have brand names worth impersonating, customers who trust email from their domain, and financial workflows that can be redirected &mdash; but they rarely have anyone whose job it is to check whether DKIM selectors are properly deployed.</p>

<p>A company running an F-grade email posture while facing an active phishing campaign isn&rsquo;t just dealing with a technical gap. It&rsquo;s facing a brand crisis that most monitoring tools won&rsquo;t even flag.</p>

<p>Fix the email foundation first. Everything else in brand protection gets easier from there.</p>
