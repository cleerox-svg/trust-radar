<article class="blog-post-body">

<p>A few months ago, I was talking with the CEO of a 300-person financial services firm. They&rsquo;d discovered &mdash; through a customer complaint, not through any monitoring tool &mdash; that someone had been running a phishing campaign using their domain name for three weeks. Three weeks of spoofed emails hitting their client base before anyone on their side knew it was happening.</p>

<p>The financial loss was significant. The trust damage was worse. And the thing that stuck with me was his question afterward: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t any of our security tools catch this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having spent years inside platforms that serve thousands of enterprise organizations, I&rsquo;ve seen this pattern from both sides. Large enterprises have the tooling, the teams, and the budgets to detect and respond to brand impersonation within hours. The mid-market doesn&rsquo;t &mdash; and attackers know it.</p>

<h3>The Numbers Are Getting Harder to Ignore</h3>

<p>The FBI&rsquo;s Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 859,000 complaints in 2024, with reported losses reaching $16.6 billion &mdash; a 33% increase year over year. Phishing and spoofing was the most-reported crime type at 193,407 complaints. Business email compromise, which relies heavily on brand impersonation, accounted for $2.77 billion in losses on its own.</p>

<p>On the domain impersonation front, the World Intellectual Property Organization handled a record 6,200 domain name disputes in 2025 &mdash; up 68% since 2020. Researchers at Zscaler ThreatLabz examined over 30,000 lookalike domains targeting just 500 major websites in a six-month window and found more than 10,000 were actively malicious.</p>

<p>These aren&rsquo;t hypothetical risks. This is the operating environment for every company with a brand.</p>

<h3>Why the Mid-Market Is in the Crosshairs</h3>

<p>In my career working across identity, access management, and digital trust platforms, I&rsquo;ve worked with organizations at every scale &mdash; from 50-person startups to the Fortune 500. The pattern is consistent: enterprise organizations have SOCs, dedicated security budgets, and the leverage to demand rapid takedowns. They still get targeted, but they have the infrastructure to respond.</p>

<p>Mid-market companies don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re large enough to have a brand worth impersonating, customers who trust communications from their domain, and transaction volumes that make fraud profitable. But they&rsquo;re small enough that security is one person&rsquo;s job among many other priorities.</p>

<p>The result is a detection gap measured in weeks, not hours. By the time a fake domain or spoofed email campaign is discovered &mdash; usually because a confused customer reaches out &mdash; the attacker has already extracted value.</p>

<p>Several things make mid-market organizations attractive targets. Incomplete email authentication is common &mdash; missing DMARC, partial DKIM deployment, SPF records that haven&rsquo;t been updated since the company changed mail providers. Social media presence is often managed by marketing teams without security oversight, leaving brand handles unclaimed on newer platforms. And customers increasingly expect the same security maturity from a 200-person company as they do from a global enterprise.</p>

<h3>The Costs You Don&rsquo;t See on the Invoice</h3>

<p>IBM&rsquo;s Cost of a Data Breach Report pegged the average phishing-related breach at $4.88 million in 2025. That number is real, but it doesn&rsquo;t capture the full picture for mid-market companies.</p>

<p>Customer trust erosion is the quiet killer. When someone receives a convincing phishing email from what appears to be your domain, they don&rsquo;t blame the attacker. They blame your brand. Support tickets spike. Existing customers question whether their data is safe. Prospective customers who hear about the incident through industry channels quietly choose a competitor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this play out in the identity and trust space specifically. When a company&rsquo;s domain is successfully impersonated, it doesn&rsquo;t just create a security incident &mdash; it undermines the trust relationship that every piece of business communication depends on. That trust is extraordinarily hard to rebuild.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the operational cost. Investigating an impersonation campaign, coordinating with domain registrars for takedowns, engaging legal counsel, notifying affected customers, and briefing the board &mdash; all of this consumes time from teams that are already stretched thin. I&rsquo;ve seen companies spend more on incident response for a single campaign than they would have spent on a full year of continuous monitoring.</p>

<h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>This is fundamentally why we built Averrow. The established brand protection platforms are excellent &mdash; and priced for organizations with dedicated security teams and budgets that start in the tens of thousands per year.</p>

<p>AI changes the equation. When intelligent agents can continuously monitor threat feeds, analyze email posture, scan for lookalike domains, and check social platforms &mdash; correlating all of it into actionable intelligence &mdash; the cost structure shifts from headcount-dependent to compute-dependent. That makes meaningful brand protection accessible to companies that need it but couldn&rsquo;t previously justify the investment.</p>

<p>Brand impersonation is accelerating globally. The question for mid-market companies isn&rsquo;t whether they&rsquo;ll be targeted. It&rsquo;s whether they&rsquo;ll know about it when it happens.</p>
