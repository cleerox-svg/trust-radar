  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, LRX Enterprises Inc. and its

    loss of profits, data, business opportunities, or goodwill, arising out of or in
    connection with your use of the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our total aggregate liability for all claims arising from or related to the Service
    shall not exceed the total fees you paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding
    the event giving rise to the claim.

  <p>
    The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not warrant that
