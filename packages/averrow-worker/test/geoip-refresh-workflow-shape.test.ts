/**
 * Regression test for the GeoipRefresh workflow's 1 MiB step-output cap.
 *
 * Cloudflare Workflows enforce a hard 1 MiB cap on each step's
 * serialized return value. Production 2026-05-04 hit
 * `WorkflowInternalError: Step import-locations-1 output is too
 * large. Maximum allowed size is 1MiB.` because the original design
 * returned a `Record<geonameId, LocationRow>` (~22 MB serialized)
 * from a dedicated "import-locations" step so a separate
 * "import-blocks" step could reuse it. Every refresh attempt failed
 * — `geo_ip_ranges` was never populated.
 *
 * The fix merges Locations + Blocks into a single `import` step.
 * The Locations Map lives entirely inside that step's closure (held
 * in Worker memory, never serialized across step boundaries) and
 * the step returns only counters.
 *
 * These tests are intentionally source-level — testing the actual
 * workflow runtime would need the Cloudflare Workflows engine,
 * which is not available in vitest. Source-level checks pin the
 * architectural invariant so any future PR that reintroduces a
 * cap-busting return path will fail CI.
