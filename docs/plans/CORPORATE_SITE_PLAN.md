### 2. FEATURE DEEP DIVES (/platform/*)

Each of the four capabilities gets a dedicated page. These are the pages a CISO or security engineer reads before recommending the product.

#### /platform/threat-detection
```
Content:
- What we monitor (feeds, CT logs, DNS, WHOIS)
- How the scanning pipeline works (30-min cron, parallel feeds, deduplication)
- Lookalike domain generation methodology (typosquat, homoglyph, TLD swap, etc.)
- Detection → Assessment → Alert flow diagram
- False positive management (safe domains allowlist)
- Sample threat alert with AI assessment
- Feed coverage table:

  | Feed Type              | Data Collected    | Update Frequency | Coverage        |
  |------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
  | Phishing databases     | Phishing URLs     | Real-time       | Global          |
  | Malware URL feeds      | Malicious URLs    | Hourly          | Global          |
  | Threat URL sources     | Suspicious URLs   | Real-time       | Global          |
  | Certificate Transparency | New certificates | Real-time       | All public CAs  |
  | Credential breach intel | Breached accounts | Daily           | Global          |
  | DNS intelligence       | DNS/routing data  | Real-time       | Global          |

Visual: Animated pipeline diagram showing data flowing through each stage
```

#### /platform/email-security
```
Content:
- Why email security posture matters for brand protection
- What we check: SPF record validation, DKIM multi-selector verification,
  DMARC policy assessment, MX provider detection
- DKIM selector coverage (list of 12+ enterprise selectors we check)
- Grading methodology (A+ through F, what each grade means)
- How email grade integrates with overall brand risk
- Example: "A company with an F email grade and active phishing = CRITICAL"
- Provider-aware scoring explanation (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Google, Microsoft)
- Comparison table: "What email security info other brand protection platforms provide"
  (answer: almost none)

Visual: Interactive email posture checker (mini version of the free scan, just email)
```

#### /platform/social-monitoring
```
Content:
- Platforms monitored (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, GitHub, YouTube)
- What we detect: impersonation accounts, handle squatting, executive impersonation,
  unauthorized brand usage, logo abuse
- How impersonation scoring works (signals: name similarity, account age, follower count,
  brand keyword usage, verification status, location mismatch)
- Handle permutation methodology (separator variations, suffix/prefix, character substitution)
- Evidence collection for takedown requests
- Platform-specific capabilities table:

  | Platform   | Handle Check | Impersonation Scan | Permutation Check | Evidence |
  |------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
  | Twitter/X  | ✓           | ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓        |
  | LinkedIn   | ✓           | ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓        |
  | Instagram  | ✓           | ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓        |
  | TikTok     | ✓           | ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓        |
  | GitHub     | ✓           | ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓        |
  | YouTube    | ✓           | ✓                 | Partial           | ✓        |

```

#### /platform/ai-agents
```
Content:
- Philosophy: "Intelligence, not alerts" — why AI agents matter
- Analyst Agent profile:
  - Role: Evaluates individual threats, correlates signals, generates assessments
  - Trigger: On new threat detection, on-demand scan, social finding
  - Output: Threat narratives, severity scoring, actionable recommendations
  - Example prompt → response showing reasoning chain

- Observer Agent profile:
  - Role: Daily intelligence briefings, trend analysis, email security monitoring
  - Trigger: Daily cron (06:00 UTC)
  - Output: Daily briefing with trend data, new findings, grade changes
  - Example briefing output

- Sales Agent profile (planned):
  - Role: Mines platform data for high-value prospects
  - Status: In development

- How agents correlate across signals:
  "The Analyst doesn't just see a phishing database hit — it sees a phishing hit PLUS
  a DKIM gap PLUS a lookalike domain with MX records, and constructs a narrative
  explaining why this combination is dangerous."

- Powered by advanced AI — transparency about the technology approach

       detection → Analyst assessment → narrative output
```

### 3. SOLUTIONS PAGES (/solutions/*)

Three use-case pages targeting specific buyer personas.

#### /solutions/mid-market
```
Headline: "Brand protection without a SOC."
Target: Companies 50-500 employees, no dedicated security team
Pain points:
  - "We know we should monitor for brand threats but don't have the team"
  - "Enterprise tools start at $20K+ and require security analysts we don't have"
  - "We found out about impersonation from a customer complaint"
Content:
  - How Trust Radar replaces a 3-person monitoring team with AI agents
  - Cost comparison: SOC analyst ($85K salary) vs Trust Radar ($799/mo)
  - What "continuous monitoring" means in practice (not just a dashboard)
  - Example: A 200-person fintech discovers 4 phishing domains in week 1
CTA: "Start with a free scan" / "See Professional plan"
```

#### /solutions/mssp
```
Headline: "Add brand threat intelligence to your managed services."
Target: Managed Security Service Providers, MSSPs, MDR providers
Pain points:
  - "Our clients ask about brand protection and we don't have an offering"
  - "We need a white-label or multi-tenant solution"
  - "We need API access and STIX export for our SIEM"
Content:
  - Multi-tenant architecture (same Worker, role-based routing, org_id isolation)
  - API-first design for integration with existing MSSP platforms
  - STIX 2.1 export for SIEM/SOAR integration
  - Revenue opportunity: "Offer brand protection at $2K-$4K/client, pay $1,999/mo for 10"
  - White-label capabilities (planned)
CTA: "Request MSSP partnership info" / "See Business plan"
```

#### /solutions/startups
```
Headline: "Protect your brand from day one."
Target: Funded startups, fast-growing companies, companies pre-IPO
Pain points:
  - "We're growing fast and attackers are noticing"
  - "We need to show investors/board we have security monitoring"
  - "We can't justify $20K+/year for brand protection yet"
Content:
  - Why early-stage companies are targets (new domains, incomplete email config)
  - The free scan as a "security audit lite" for board presentations
  - Email security posture as low-hanging fruit (fix your DKIM, improve your score)
  - Growth signals that attract attackers (press coverage, hiring, funding announcements)
CTA: "Run your free scan" / "See Professional plan"
```

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE

### How pages work in the Cloudflare Worker SPA

All pages are served by the same Worker. The Worker matches the URL path and returns the appropriate HTML. This is NOT a static site generator — it's a Worker that renders HTML server-side.

```typescript
// Simplified routing in the Worker
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const path = url.pathname;

    // Public marketing pages
    if (path === '/') return renderPage(landingPage, env);
    if (path === '/platform') return renderPage(platformPage, env);
    if (path === '/pricing') return renderPage(pricingPage, env);
    if (path === '/about') return renderPage(aboutPage, env);
    if (path === '/contact') return renderPage(contactPage, env);
    if (path === '/security') return renderPage(securityPage, env);
    if (path === '/blog') return renderPage(blogIndex, env);
    if (path.startsWith('/blog/')) return renderBlogPost(path, env);
    if (path === '/changelog') return renderPage(changelogPage, env);
    if (path === '/scan') return renderPage(scanPage, env);
    // ... etc

    // Auth pages
    if (path === '/login') return renderPage(loginPage, env);
    if (path === '/register') return renderPage(registerPage, env);

    // API routes
    if (path.startsWith('/api/')) return handleAPI(request, env);

    // Dashboard (authenticated)
    if (path.startsWith('/dashboard')) return renderDashboard(request, env);

    // Legal
    if (path === '/privacy') return renderPage(privacyPage, env);
    if (path === '/terms') return renderPage(termsPage, env);

    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
  }
};
```

### Page rendering pattern

Each page is a function that returns an HTML string. Shared components (nav, footer, head, styles) are composed into a layout wrapper.

```typescript
function renderPage(pageContent: (env: Env) => string, env: Env): Response {
  const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en" data-theme="light">
    <head>${sharedHead()}</head>
    <body>
      ${sharedNav()}
      ${pageContent(env)}
      ${sharedFooter()}
      ${sharedScripts()}
    </body>
    </html>
  `;
  return new Response(html, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8' }
  });
}
```

## ADVANCED GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION PACKAGES

### For Claude Code — Install and Use These

The corporate site and dashboard need rich, animated, data-driven visuals — not static icons and colored divs. Here's what to use and where.

### NPM Packages for the Worker Build

These are installed in `packages/trust-radar/` via pnpm:

```bash
# Visualization & charting (client-side, bundled into Worker output)
pnpm add d3                    # Force-directed graphs, geographic projections, data viz
pnpm add three                 # 3D radar globe, threat network visualization
pnpm add @deck.gl/core @deck.gl/layers  # Geographic threat map (with MapLibre GL)
pnpm add maplibre-gl           # Map tiles for threat geography
pnpm add recharts              # Score trends, email grade history, threat volume charts

# Animation
pnpm add framer-motion         # Page transitions, scroll reveals, micro-interactions
pnpm add @lottiefiles/lottie-player  # Custom animated illustrations (radar sweep, scanning)

# Server-side image generation (for OG cards / shareable reports)
pnpm add @resvg/resvg-wasm    # SVG → PNG rendering in Worker (WASM-based, CF compatible)
pnpm add satori                # HTML/CSS → SVG (Vercel's OG image library, works in Workers)
```

### CDN Resources (loaded client-side, no build step)

```html
<!-- MapLibre GL for geographic threat maps -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@3.6.2/dist/maplibre-gl.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@3.6.2/dist/maplibre-gl.js"></script>

<!-- CARTO Dark Matter tiles (free, no API key for low volume) -->
<!-- Use in MapLibre: style URL = https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/dark-matter-gl-style/style.json -->

<!-- Lottie for pre-built animations -->

### Specific Visual Specifications

#### 1. Landing Page Hero — 3D Radar Globe (Three.js)

```
- Dark wireframe globe (low-poly, ~2000 faces)
- Rotates slowly on Y axis
- Threat nodes rendered as glowing red/amber dots on the globe surface
- Safe nodes as green dots
- Arc lines connecting threat sources to target (brand's country)
- On hover: tooltip showing domain name and threat type
- Camera slightly tilted (15° from equator)
- Ambient light + point light from upper-right
- Performance: requestAnimationFrame with throttle, pause when off-screen
- Fallback: Static SVG radar for mobile / low-performance devices
```

#### 2. Threat Relationship Graph (d3 force-directed)

```
- Used in threat narratives and dashboard threat view
- Nodes: domains, IPs, brand names
- Edges: shared hosting, shared registrar, shared MX, cert overlap
- Node colors: red (threat), amber (suspicious), green (official), gray (infrastructure)
- Node size: proportional to number of connections
- Interactive: click node to see details, drag to rearrange
- Zoom/pan enabled
- Layout: d3.forceSimulation with forceLink, forceManyBody, forceCenter
- Animation: nodes float into position over 1.5s on render
```

#### 3. Geographic Threat Map (deck.gl + MapLibre)

```
- CARTO Dark Matter base tiles (dark theme)
- ScatterplotLayer: threat locations as pulsing red dots
- ArcLayer: arcs from threat origin to brand's HQ location
- HeatmapLayer: density of threats by region
- Tooltip on hover: domain, IP, hosting provider, country
- Zoom level: start at world view, zoom to region on click
- Dark mode only (map tiles are dark, looks wrong on light bg)
  → On light theme, show a simplified version or toggle map bg
```

#### 4. Brand Exposure Score Gauge (SVG + CSS animation)

```
- Circular gauge (270° arc, not full circle)
- Animated fill from 0 to actual score on page load
- Color gradient: green (90+) → wing-blue (70-89) → afterburner amber (50-69) → red (<50)
- Center: large score number with count-up animation
- Below: grade letter (A+ through F)
- Subtle glow effect matching the score color
- Responsive: scales from 120px to 200px diameter
```

#### 5. Shareable Report OG Image (satori + resvg)

```
- Generated server-side by the Worker when a scan report URL is shared
- Endpoint: GET /api/scan/report/:id/og → returns PNG
- Dimensions: 1200x630 (standard OG image)
- Content:
  - Trust Radar logo (top-left)
  - Domain name (large, center)
  - Brand Exposure Score (large gauge)
  - Grade badges for each category (Email: B+, Social: 1 alert, etc.)
  - "Generated by Trust Radar" footer
- Linked in HTML meta tags:
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://trustradar.ca/api/scan/report/:id/og" />
```

#### 6. Scanning Animation (Lottie or CSS)

```
- Used on /scan page while report is generating (3-8 seconds)
- Radar sweep animation (circular sweep, dots appearing)
- Progress indicators for each scan stage:
  ● Email security scan... ✓
  ● Threat feed check... ✓
  ● Lookalike domain scan... (scanning)
  ● Social handle check... (queued)
  ● AI assessment... (queued)
- Each stage transitions from gray → pulsing afterburner amber → green check
- Smooth, not janky — use requestAnimationFrame or Lottie
```

### Cloudflare Worker Compatibility Notes

```
⚠ IMPORTANT: Not all npm packages work in Cloudflare Workers.
Workers use the V8 isolate runtime, NOT Node.js.

WORKS IN WORKERS (server-side):
- satori (HTML → SVG, pure JS)
- @resvg/resvg-wasm (SVG → PNG, WASM-based)
- Any pure JS library without Node.js dependencies

CLIENT-SIDE ONLY (bundled into HTML, runs in browser):
- three (Three.js) — always client-side
- d3 — always client-side
- deck.gl / MapLibre GL — always client-side
- recharts — always client-side (React)
- framer-motion — always client-side (React)
- Lottie player — always client-side

DOES NOT WORK IN WORKERS:
- sharp (uses native binaries — use @resvg/resvg-wasm instead)
- canvas (Node.js native — use satori + resvg instead)
- puppeteer (headless browser — not possible in Workers)
```

### Build Configuration

For the Worker SPA that serves client-side code, graphics libraries are bundled during build:

```typescript
// wrangler.toml additions for large bundles
[build]
command = "pnpm build"

// Consider code splitting for heavy libraries:
// - Three.js (~600KB) → lazy load only on landing page
// - d3 (~250KB) → lazy load on dashboard pages
// - deck.gl + MapLibre (~800KB) → lazy load on threat map view
// - recharts (~200KB) → lazy load on dashboard

// Total bundle without lazy loading: ~2MB+
// With lazy loading per-route: ~100-200KB initial, rest on demand
```

### Claude Code Execution Notes

```
When building pages that use these packages:

1. THREE.JS: Import from CDN in the HTML served by the Worker.
   Do NOT try to bundle Three.js into the Worker itself.
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>

2. D3: Same approach — CDN for the SPA, not bundled into Worker.
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js"></script>

3. RECHARTS: If using React for dashboard components,
   bundle with the client-side build.

4. SATORI + RESVG: These DO run inside the Worker for OG image generation.
   Install as regular dependencies.

5. MAPLIBRE GL: CDN load with CSS.
   Tiles from CARTO (free tier, no API key needed for modest volume).

6. LOTTIE: CDN load the player. Host .lottie/.json animation
   files in Cloudflare R2 or serve inline.
```
