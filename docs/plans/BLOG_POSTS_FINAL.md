### Content:

I spent years working inside enterprise identity and digital trust platforms — the kind that handle authentication for thousands of global organizations. You see everything from that vantage point: how Fortune 500 companies manage access, how mid-market companies try to keep up, and where the gaps are that nobody's watching.

The biggest gap I kept seeing wasn't in network security or endpoint protection. It was in email authentication. Organizations would invest heavily in SSO, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust architecture — all the right things — while leaving their email domain completely open to impersonation.

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are the protocols that determine whether an attacker can send email that genuinely appears to come from your domain. Not a lookalike domain. Your actual domain, with your brand name in the "From" field, landing in your customers' inboxes. When these are misconfigured or absent — and they usually are — it's open season.

The numbers confirm what I saw firsthand. A 2025 analysis by Red Sift across more than 73 million domains found that roughly 84% have no DMARC record at all. Only about 2.5% enforce the strictest "reject" policy that actually blocks spoofed messages. EasyDMARC's global adoption report confirmed the trend: even among the top 1.8 million domains worldwide, over 80% either lack DMARC entirely or run a non-enforcing policy that's essentially decorative.

The vast majority of domains on the internet can be impersonated via email with virtually no friction. If you've worked in identity and access management, you know how absurd that is — it's the equivalent of deploying SSO for your applications while leaving the front door of the building unlocked.

**A Quick Primer on What These Protocols Do**

For those who haven't spent their weekends reading DNS records, here's the short version:

**SPF** publishes a list of servers authorized to send email for your domain. If a message comes from an IP not on the list, it fails the check.

**DKIM** attaches a cryptographic signature to your outgoing email. The receiving server verifies it against a public key in your DNS. This confirms the message is authentic and hasn't been tampered with in transit.

**DMARC** ties SPF and DKIM together and adds a policy — it tells receiving mail servers what to do when a message fails authentication. Monitor it, quarantine it, or reject it outright.

When all three are properly configured and enforced, spoofing your domain via email goes from trivial to extremely difficult. When they're not — and for 80%+ of domains, they're not — an attacker doesn't even need a lookalike domain. They can impersonate you directly.

**The Blind Spot in Brand Protection**

Here's what genuinely surprised me when we built Trust Radar: none of the major brand protection platforms analyze email authentication as part of their monitoring. Not one.

They'll detect a phishing URL. They'll flag a fake social media account. They'll find your brand name on a dark web forum. But they won't tell you that your DKIM is half-configured and your DMARC policy is set to "none" — which means every one of those other threats is significantly more dangerous than it needs to be.

Having worked on platforms where authentication was the core product, this gap was impossible to ignore. Email authentication is identity verification for your domain. If you can't prove that an email came from you, you can't prove that one didn't.

That's why we built email security posture analysis into the core of Trust Radar. We check SPF validity, verify DKIM across multiple enterprise email security selectors, assess DMARC policy enforcement, and detect your MX provider. We grade the whole picture from A+ to F and track it over time.

**Why This Hits Mid-Market Companies Hardest**

The FBI's IC3 reported $2.77 billion in business email compromise losses across 21,442 incidents in 2024. That was second only to investment fraud in total dollar losses, and those are just the reported cases.

From my experience working with enterprise customers globally, the large organizations generally have this covered — they have security teams that enforce authentication standards. The mid-market is where the risk concentrates. These companies have brand names worth impersonating, customers who trust email from their domain, and financial workflows that can be redirected — but they rarely have anyone whose job it is to check whether DKIM selectors are properly deployed.

A company running an F-grade email posture while facing an active phishing campaign isn't just dealing with a technical gap. It's facing a brand crisis that most monitoring tools won't even flag.

Fix the email foundation first. Everything else in brand protection gets easier from there.

**Title:** The Real Cost of Brand Impersonation for Mid-Market Companies
**Category:** THREAT INTEL
**Date:** March 10, 2026
**Author:** Claude Leroux
**Slug:** cost-brand-impersonation-mid-market

### Content:

A few months ago, I was talking with the CEO of a 300-person financial services firm. They'd discovered — through a customer complaint, not through any monitoring tool — that someone had been running a phishing campaign using their domain name for three weeks. Three weeks of spoofed emails hitting their client base before anyone on their side knew it was happening.

The financial loss was significant. The trust damage was worse. And the thing that stuck with me was his question afterward: "Why didn't any of our security tools catch this?"

Having spent years inside platforms that serve thousands of enterprise organizations, I've seen this pattern from both sides. Large enterprises have the tooling, the teams, and the budgets to detect and respond to brand impersonation within hours. The mid-market doesn't — and attackers know it.

**The Numbers Are Getting Harder to Ignore**

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 859,000 complaints in 2024, with reported losses reaching $16.6 billion — a 33% increase year over year. Phishing and spoofing was the most-reported crime type at 193,407 complaints. Business email compromise, which relies heavily on brand impersonation, accounted for $2.77 billion in losses on its own.

On the domain impersonation front, the World Intellectual Property Organization handled a record 6,200 domain name disputes in 2025 — up 68% since 2020. Researchers at Zscaler ThreatLabz examined over 30,000 lookalike domains targeting just 500 major websites in a six-month window and found more than 10,000 were actively malicious.

These aren't hypothetical risks. This is the operating environment for every company with a brand.

**Why the Mid-Market Is in the Crosshairs**

In my career working across identity, access management, and digital trust platforms, I've worked with organizations at every scale — from 50-person startups to the Fortune 500. The pattern is consistent: enterprise organizations have SOCs, dedicated security budgets, and the leverage to demand rapid takedowns. They still get targeted, but they have the infrastructure to respond.

Mid-market companies don't. They're large enough to have a brand worth impersonating, customers who trust communications from their domain, and transaction volumes that make fraud profitable. But they're small enough that security is one person's job among many other priorities.

The result is a detection gap measured in weeks, not hours. By the time a fake domain or spoofed email campaign is discovered — usually because a confused customer reaches out — the attacker has already extracted value.

Several things make mid-market organizations attractive targets. Incomplete email authentication is common — missing DMARC, partial DKIM deployment, SPF records that haven't been updated since the company changed mail providers. Social media presence is often managed by marketing teams without security oversight, leaving brand handles unclaimed on newer platforms. And customers increasingly expect the same security maturity from a 200-person company as they do from a global enterprise.

**The Costs You Don't See on the Invoice**

IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report pegged the average phishing-related breach at $4.88 million in 2025. That number is real, but it doesn't capture the full picture for mid-market companies.

Customer trust erosion is the quiet killer. When someone receives a convincing phishing email from what appears to be your domain, they don't blame the attacker. They blame your brand. Support tickets spike. Existing customers question whether their data is safe. Prospective customers who hear about the incident through industry channels quietly choose a competitor.

I've watched this play out in the identity and trust space specifically. When a company's domain is successfully impersonated, it doesn't just create a security incident — it undermines the trust relationship that every piece of business communication depends on. That trust is extraordinarily hard to rebuild.

Then there's the operational cost. Investigating an impersonation campaign, coordinating with domain registrars for takedowns, engaging legal counsel, notifying affected customers, and briefing the board — all of this consumes time from teams that are already stretched thin. I've seen companies spend more on incident response for a single campaign than they would have spent on a full year of continuous monitoring.

**Bridging the Gap**

This is fundamentally why we built Trust Radar. The established brand protection platforms are excellent — and priced for organizations with dedicated security teams and budgets that start in the tens of thousands per year.

AI changes the equation. When intelligent agents can continuously monitor threat feeds, analyze email posture, scan for lookalike domains, and check social platforms — correlating all of it into actionable intelligence — the cost structure shifts from headcount-dependent to compute-dependent. That makes meaningful brand protection accessible to companies that need it but couldn't previously justify the investment.

Brand impersonation is accelerating globally. The question for mid-market companies isn't whether they'll be targeted. It's whether they'll know about it when it happens.

**Title:** Introducing AI-Powered Threat Narratives
**Category:** PRODUCT
**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Author:** Claude Leroux
**Slug:** ai-powered-threat-narratives

### Content:

If you've ever worked in or around a security operations center, you know the paradox: the more you monitor, the more alerts you generate, and the harder it gets to find the ones that actually matter.

I spent years working inside platforms that process millions of authentication events, access requests, and security signals every day. The challenge is always the same — not collecting enough data, but turning data into decisions. The organizations I worked with didn't need more alerts. They needed someone (or something) to tell them what the alerts meant.

That's the problem Trust Radar's AI agents are designed to solve. Instead of generating more alerts, they generate threat narratives: human-readable intelligence briefs that connect dots across multiple data sources and explain the "so what" behind each finding.

**The Alert Fatigue Reality**

Traditional brand protection works on a detect-and-notify model. Phishing domain found — alert. Social media impersonation detected — alert. Email authentication gap discovered — alert.

Each alert is technically accurate and technically useless in isolation. A new domain containing your brand name might be a squatter, a partner, a typo, or the opening move in a coordinated phishing campaign. The alert doesn't tell you which. That determination requires context: what else is happening, what infrastructure is involved, and how it connects to your specific exposure.

In enterprise environments, I've seen organizations with dedicated identity and security teams who still struggle with this. They have the people and the tools, and they're still drowning in disconnected signals. For mid-market companies where security is one person's part-time responsibility, the alerts just accumulate.

**How Threat Narratives Change the Model**

Trust Radar's Analyst agent doesn't work in the traditional alert pipeline. It receives signals from across the platform — email security posture analysis, threat feed matches, lookalike domain monitoring, social platform scanning, certificate transparency data — and synthesizes them into narratives.

Let me walk through a concrete example.

On a Tuesday morning, three domains are registered: acme-login.net, acme-portal.com, and acmecorp-secure.net. In a traditional monitoring tool, each might generate a low or medium-severity alert — new domains containing a brand name aren't automatically malicious. Plenty of them are parked, abandoned, or legitimate.

But our Analyst agent sees the broader picture. All three domains were registered within 48 hours. They share a hosting provider. That provider's IP range includes an address flagged in a phishing intelligence database for targeting the same brand. And two of the three domains have MX records configured — meaning they're set up to send and receive email, not just serve web pages.

The agent then pulls the brand's email security posture into the analysis. It finds DKIM is only partially deployed — two of five enterprise selectors are active — which means spoofed emails from these new domains have a higher probability of passing recipient filters.

The resulting narrative connects everything: three coordinated domains, shared infrastructure linked to known phishing, email capability on two of them, and a corresponding authentication gap in the target's defenses. Severity: HIGH. The narrative includes the full reasoning chain and specific recommendations — expand DKIM coverage, submit the domains to registrar abuse contacts, enable certificate transparency monitoring.

No individual alert would have produced this picture. The intelligence comes from correlation — the same kind of cross-signal analysis that a senior security analyst would perform, but running continuously across every monitored brand.

**Daily Briefings from the Observer**

The Analyst handles active threats. Trust Radar's Observer agent handles the rhythm of ongoing monitoring.

Every day, the Observer generates an intelligence briefing summarizing the last 24 hours: new findings across all monitored brands, changes in email security grades, social monitoring updates, threat volume trends, and anything that warrants attention. Think of it as a morning brief from an analyst who processes every data point and never takes a day off.

For someone managing security alongside other responsibilities — which describes most people outside of large enterprise SOCs — this is the difference between logging into a dashboard hoping nothing bad happened and starting the day with a clear picture of where things stand.

**Why This Matters for Global Organizations**

The threat landscape doesn't respect time zones, jurisdictions, or geography. An attacker in one country can register a domain, set up email infrastructure, and launch a phishing campaign targeting an organization on the other side of the world — all within hours.

Working across global customer bases taught me that the organizations most vulnerable to brand threats aren't the ones with the weakest security posture overall. They're the ones with gaps between their detection systems — where no single tool has the full picture. AI threat narratives close those gaps by correlating across every signal source simultaneously.

Trust Radar's approach isn't about replacing human judgment. It's about making sure that when a human does look at a threat, they see intelligence — not a list of disconnected alerts they don't have time to investigate.

**Title:** Lookalike Domains: The Threat Hiding in Plain Sight
**Category:** THREAT INTEL
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Author:** Claude Leroux
**Slug:** lookalike-domains-threat-hiding

### Content:

I run domain permutation scans regularly as part of my own security practice, and the results are always sobering. Even for a relatively modest brand, you'll find dozens of registered variants — some parked, some serving content, and occasionally one that's clearly been set up to impersonate you.

Having worked inside platforms where brand trust is the product — where the entire value proposition depends on customers believing that a communication genuinely came from who it says it came from — I've seen firsthand what happens when that trust gets exploited. Domain impersonation isn't just a technical threat. It's an attack on the fundamental relationship between a brand and its customers.

The numbers at scale are staggering. In 2025, the World Intellectual Property Organization handled a record 6,200 domain name disputes — a 68% increase since 2020. Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers examined over 30,000 lookalike domains targeting just 500 major websites in six months and found more than 10,000 were actively malicious.

If you're not monitoring for lookalike domains, the question isn't whether they exist. It's how many there are and what they're being used for.

**The Techniques Behind the Threat**

Lookalike domain attacks work because humans don't read URLs character by character. We scan. We recognize patterns. And we're remarkably bad at catching small deviations, especially on mobile devices where the URL bar shows maybe 20 characters before truncating.

Attackers exploit this with several well-established techniques:

**Character omission** is the simplest — remove one letter and see if anyone notices. "trustradar" becomes "trustadar." The missing 'r' is nearly invisible when you're scanning quickly, particularly in an email hyperlink.

**Adjacent character swaps** transpose neighboring letters. "trustradar" becomes "trusrtadar." Our brains are surprisingly good at reading transposed text — it's the same reason you can understand a sentence with jumbled middle letters — which is precisely what makes the attack effective.

**Homoglyph substitution** is the nastiest variant. It replaces characters with visually identical ones from different Unicode character sets. The Latin 'a' and Cyrillic 'а' are indistinguishable in virtually every font, but they're different code points. A domain registered with Cyrillic substitutions can appear absolutely identical to the legitimate one. Having worked with authentication systems that verify identity across hundreds of applications, I can tell you that this kind of deception — where something looks exactly right but isn't — is the hardest class of attack to defend against.

**TLD swaps** register the same brand name under alternative top-level domains. If you own yourcompany.com, an attacker might grab yourcompany.net, .co, .io, or any of the hundreds of available extensions. It's cheap, it's easy, and it works because most people assume a familiar brand name under any TLD is legitimate.

**Keyword additions** append trust-signaling words: "yourcompany-login.com," "yourcompany-support.net," "yourcompany-secure.org." Pair these with a free SSL certificate — which gives you the padlock icon in the browser — and you've got a phishing site that passes casual inspection.

**The Scale Has Industrialized**

This isn't one person manually registering a clever domain. Modern lookalike campaigns are automated, bulk operations. Open-source tools can generate thousands of permutations in seconds. Attackers register them in batches through budget registrars, often using stolen payment credentials, and deploy phishing infrastructure across the lot simultaneously.

A Krebs on Security investigation found that the majority of parked lookalike domains now redirect visitors to malicious content — a dramatic shift from a decade ago, when fewer than 5% served malicious payloads. The infrastructure has matured from opportunistic to industrial.

The mobile threat vector compounds the problem. On a phone, URL bars are truncated. A user might see "yourcompany-sec..." and reasonably assume they're on a legitimate page. In a world where more business communication happens on mobile than desktop, the ergonomics of mobile browsing actively work in the attacker's favor.

**Why Reactive Monitoring Isn't Enough**

Most domain monitoring services work by checking blacklists or scanning for known suspicious domains. That's useful, but it's reactive — the domain has to be flagged by someone else before you find out about it.

Proactive monitoring works differently. You generate the full set of plausible permutations for your domain, covering every technique: omission, swap, homoglyph, TLD, keyword addition, and subdomain tricks. You check which permutations are registered. For those that are, you monitor for signs of weaponization — active web content, MX records indicating email capability, freshly issued SSL certificates.

That's the approach we built into Trust Radar. When you add a brand, the domain permutation engine generates hundreds of variants, checks their registration and DNS configuration, and feeds the results to our AI engine for risk scoring. A parked domain scores differently than one with active hosting, an MX record, and a certificate issued yesterday.

**What You Can Do Right Now**

You don't need a monitoring platform to start protecting yourself. Register your brand name across the most common TLDs — .com, .net, .org, .co, and your country-code domain. Grab the obvious misspellings and the hyphenated variant. This is cheap insurance that eliminates the lowest-effort attacks.

Enforce SPF, DKIM, and DMARC at the strictest level your infrastructure supports. This won't prevent someone from registering a lookalike domain, but it makes email-based impersonation from those domains less likely to succeed — and it signals to receiving mail servers that you take email authentication seriously.

And start monitoring. The threat isn't slowing down — domain squatting disputes are at record highs, AI is making phishing content more convincing, and the barrier to entry for attackers keeps dropping. Every day your brand goes unmonitored is a day someone could be building infrastructure designed to look exactly like you.
