# Averrow Improvement Plan — July 2026

**Source:** `docs/PLATFORM_ASSESSMENT_2026-07.md` (2026-07-17, nine parallel code-level
lenses). Supersedes the open items of `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026-06.md`.

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the code does and what the platform says about
itself — fixing live operational/security sharp edges first, then re-anchoring positioning
and terminology, then closing the differentiator claim — while preserving the
minimal-cost operating model.

**Format:** Waves of PR-sized sessions. Each session = one branch + one draft PR, follows
CLAUDE.md standards (tsc clean, `check:resource-drift`, tests, `agent_runs`/`agent_events`,
prepared statements, cubes/pre-computed columns over raw scans) and the default build
pipeline (plan → build → test → verify → review → ship).

**Status legend:** ⬜ not started · 🟡 in progress · ✅ landed

## Working agreement — human-in-the-loop gates (unchanged from June)

No session is built without explicit scope approval. Anything that sends external traffic
(takedown dispatch, GSB/APWG submissions, customer digests) ships **dark behind a config
flag, default off** — the owner flips it. Always the owner's call: pricing/billing,
MSA/legal text, anything sent to a customer or third party, agent retirement/promotion,
external service signups. **Every gap ID below (C#, S#, D#, R#, T#, TK#) maps to the
identically-named row in the assessment's §3.**

---

## Wave 0 — Urgent / live / security-material (days, high certainty) — ✅ COMPLETE (all 5 sessions live 2026-07-18; Deployment Phases 0–3)

> **Resume point for a new session:** Wave 0 is fully shipped. Start next at **Wave 1 /
> S1.0** (naming occurrence map — prerequisite for S1.1–S1.6). The 24h post-deploy
> diagnostics verification for S0.1/S0.2/S0.4 has run (2026-07-19) — see
> `docs/deploy-baselines/phase-2-3-verify-2026-07-19.md` and the handoff block in
> `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PHASES_2026-07.md`. S0.2/S0.4 passed; S0.1's scanner cadence passed;
> S0.1's `ct_monitor` telemetry regressed (fixed in migration 0238 / PR #1641, merged) and
> still needs a post-merge re-verification.

The assessment surfaced live-firing and security-material issues that are small, bounded,
and high-confidence. These go first.

### S0.1 — Kill the live agent starvation (R1 + R2) ✅ *(PR #1637, live 2026-07-18; 24h verified 2026-07-19)*
**Owner:** backend-engineer → qa-verifier. CT monitor, lookalike scanner, and trademark
scan run inline at the tail of the hourly orchestrator tick and drop ~67% of runs.
- Give each a **dedicated cron** using the exact `event.cron`-match template already used
  by enricher/cartographer/greynoise/seclookup/strategist/sparrow/social/brand-scores
  (`cron/orchestrator.ts`, `wrangler.toml`). Audit minute-gates per the cron-audit rule.
- Wrap `runCTMonitor` in `executeAgent` so `ct_monitor` writes `agent_runs` and becomes
  visible to Flight Control's stall watchdog (`scanners/ct-monitor.ts`).
- **Verify:** re-run `./scripts/platform-diagnostics.sh 24` after a full day; lookalike +
  trademark should show 24/24, `ct_monitor` should have `agent_runs` rows.
- **Result (2026-07-19):** scanner cadence ✅ — lookalike/trademark at 17/24 in the
  straddled deploy window (a mid-window-deploy artifact; hourly post-deploy, 24/24 on a
  clean day). `ct_monitor` telemetry ❌ regressed — the PR omitted `ct_monitor`'s
  `agent_approvals` grandfather row, so `executeAgent`'s deployment-approval gate blocked
  every tick and `pollCertificates` never ran in prod. Fixed by
  `migrations/0238_ct_monitor_approval.sql` (PR #1641, merged); post-merge re-verification
  still outstanding. Full record: `docs/deploy-baselines/phase-2-3-verify-2026-07-19.md`.

### S0.2 — DNS-queue drift root-cause + fix (R3) ✅ *(PR #1638, live 2026-07-18 — root cause was a phantom diagnostics metric, not a backlog; became a metric-correctness fix)*
**Owner:** backend-engineer / platform-sre. Live delta 8,851 rows (18× the FC alert
threshold) with no visible `platform_dns_queue_drift` notification.
- Trigger `POST /api/internal/dns-queue/reap`, inspect the `ReaperResult`
  (`softCapHit`/`batchesFailed`/`staleRemoved`) for soft-cap truncation
  (`lib/dns-queue-reaper.ts`, `REAPER_SOFT_CAP_MS`).
- Confirm whether `platform_dns_queue_drift` is firing-but-deduped (`todayKey()` group
  key) or genuinely never firing despite the crossed threshold (`flightControl.ts:749-849`).

### S0.3 — Security P0: decouple the internal-secret escalation (S1 + S2) ✅ *(PR #1635, live 2026-07-18 — auditor-only preview mint + AVERROW_PREVIEW_SECRET split; requireStaffMutation on 37 mutation routes)*
**Owner:** backend-engineer → appsec-reviewer. Two convergent findings, one root area.
- **S1:** drop `admin` from `UI_PREVIEW_STAFF_ROLES` (`handlers/auth.ts:1047`; default is
  already read-only `auditor`), and/or gate the two mint endpoints behind a **separate,
  more tightly-held secret** than the diagnostics/agent-trigger `AVERROW_INTERNAL_SECRET`
  so a diagnostics token can't be upgraded to admin.
- **S2:** make `auditor` read-only a **mechanism, not a convention** — move every
  `requireStaff`-gated *mutation* behind a `StaffPermission` flag (`auditor` holds no
  edit/manage flags), or give `auditor` its own hierarchy tier below the staff quartet and
  convert `requireStaff` to a role-set membership test. Audit
  `routes/brands.ts`/`investigations.ts`/`email-security.ts`/`scan.ts`.

### S0.4 — D1 hot-path discipline (T1) ✅ *(PR #1639, live 2026-07-18 — 4 of 9 sites swapped to cubes/pre-computed columns; the other 5 are entity-bounded, not full-table scans, left as-is with guard comments; 24h D1-budget verify pending)*
**Owner:** backend-engineer → qa-verifier. Swap the 9 page-load `GROUP BY`-over-threats
aggregates to the matching cube / pre-computed column (`providers.ts` already does it
right): `dashboard.ts:273/295`, `brands.ts:789/1125/1203`, `campaigns.ts:81/91`,
`trends.ts:116/257/280`. **Verify** row counts match the old queries before/after.

### S0.5 — Takedown status-flip integrity fix (TK1) ✅ *(PR #1636, live 2026-07-18 — →submitted gated on owning-org + authorization, reusing Sparrow Phase G predicates)*
**Owner:** backend-engineer → appsec-reviewer. `handleAdminUpdateTakedown`
(`handlers/takedowns.ts:464-563`) can stamp *any* takedown — including orgless/unauthorized —
as `submitted` with no standing check. Gate the `draft→submitted` transition on an owning
org (`org_brands`) + an active per-org authorization, or forbid the manual `submitted`
status entirely unless it accompanies a real dispatch record. This makes the takedown
audit trail truthful.

## Wave 1 — Terminology & positioning re-anchor (1–2 wks, high commercial leverage, low code risk)

Executes `docs/TERMINOLOGY_LEXICON_2026-07.md` and the "re-anchor now" half of the
differentiator decision. Mostly copy/config; low blast radius; high commercial upside.

> **Rename-safety gate (applies to every session in this wave).** Per the founder
> directive and lexicon §0: **display-layer renames only, unless a structural rename passes
> the full protocol.** No `agent_id`, DB table/column, API route, role string, or
> notification/event `type` key is renamed without (a) the deep occurrence trace in
> `docs/NAMING_RENAME_SAFETY_2026-07.md`, (b) a migration, and (c) a `qa-verifier` gate
> proving the renamed thing still dispatches/authorizes/groups/returns. Default is
> **rename the human-visible string, keep the identifier.** One PR per coherent rename.

### S1.0 — Naming occurrence map & rename-safety review (prerequisite for S1.1–S1.3) ⬜
**Owner:** backend-engineer + appsec-reviewer + market-analyst → docs-maintainer.
Produce `docs/NAMING_RENAME_SAFETY_2026-07.md` — the per-name occurrence map across every
layer (DB, migrations, API, `agent_id`, KV/JWT/`type` keys, ops UI, tenant UI, marketing,
tests, averrow-mcp), each classified DISPLAY-SAFE / STRUCTURAL / DELETE, with the safe
execution path and the exact test that proves no breakage. Also produce the **menu/nav
alignment table** (each ops + tenant nav item → does the label match its signal/purpose →
recommended label aligned to DRP category + competitor nomenclature). S1.1–S1.3 execute
FROM this map; they do not re-decide it.

### S1.1 — Purge internal code names from customer surfaces (§5.1–5.2) ⬜
**Owner:** content-strategist + frontend-engineer. Remove Sentinel/ASTRA/Observer/
Navigator/**Blackbox**/Pathfinder as *primary* labels from the marketing site and the
public changelog; replace with the single functional labels from the lexicon. Kill the
**Blackbox phantom** entirely. Fix the tenant leaks ("Sparrow" `TakedownDetail.tsx:146`,
"cockpit" `Console.tsx`).

### S1.2 — Fix the three wrong agent descriptions (§5.3) ⬜
**Owner:** content-strategist. Navigator (DNS resolution, not geo — geo is Cartographer);
remove Pathfinder from *customer-protection* framing entirely (it is an internal sales
tool); reconcile Blackbox→Narrator/Observer.

### S1.3 — Canonicalize core nouns (§5.4) ⬜
**Owner:** content-strategist + frontend-engineer. Pick one term each (alert|signal,
exposure score, campaign, cluster, investigation) per the lexicon and apply across
ops/tenant/marketing; align the `/alerts` route label with its chosen noun.

### S1.4 — Adopt the DRPS category label + SEO (C4) ⬜
**Owner:** seo-strategist + content-strategist. Work "Digital Risk Protection / DRPS" into
meta descriptions and ≥1 prominent on-page mention without displacing brand voice.

### S1.5 — Surface real, unmarketed capabilities (C2, C3, C6) ⬜
**Owner:** content-strategist + web-copywriter. Name and explain: **standing-gated takedown
execution** (with a real metric once S2.x instruments it), infrastructure/campaign
clustering (a "Threat Graph" equivalent), executive-name monitoring, and a defined
`/platform/campaign-intelligence` page. **Do not publish any takedown speed/volume/success
number until engineering confirms it** (see S2.1).

### S1.6 — Re-anchor the differentiator trio (§6, C1) ⬜
**Owner:** content-strategist. Shift homepage/platform emphasis off "42 agents" onto the
free scan + transparency + edge-native price/cost story. Stop implying behavioral
actor-attribution.

---

## Wave 2 — Takedown surfaces + close the differentiator claim (invest half of "both")

### S2.1 — Takedown metrics instrumentation (C2 prerequisite) ⬜
**Owner:** backend-engineer. Compute submission→resolution time, monthly volume, and
success rate from `takedown_submissions`. Expose to ops; gate any *public* number behind
owner sign-off. Unblocks the S1.5 marketing claim with a real figure.

### S2.2 — Averrow-analyst hand-submit path (TK2) ⬜
**Owner:** backend-engineer → appsec-reviewer. Build one authenticated ops endpoint
(gated on `manage_takedowns`) that re-runs Phase G's per-row standing checks
(`requireAuthorizationForModule` + entitlement + provider resolve) then calls
`dispatchSubmission` — a single-takedown, human-triggered Phase G for the "auto is on but
this one needs a human" case. Ships dark behind the existing `TAKEDOWN_SEND_MODE` gate.

### S2.3 — Ops "Takedowns" → two surfaces (TK3) ✅ *(scope segmented-control on the `org_id IS NULL/NOT NULL` axis inside the existing Takedowns page — Authorized (customer) vs Prospect (orgless drafts, grouped by brand, deep-linking to BrandDetail Risk); backend `scope`/`brand_id` params + scoped `status_counts`; no new endpoint/nav/route)*
**Owner:** frontend-engineer + backend-engineer. Split the Ops takedown feature by purpose:
1. **Authorized execution** — the current SOC tracking/queue view (opted-in customers).
2. **Prospect / pitch lane** — a per-brand "everything we'd action for you" view composing
   existing ingredients: the orgless Sparrow drafts already in `/api/admin/takedowns`
   (`takedowns.ts:419-429`), BrandDetail's Risk tab, and the exposure-scan/qualified-report
   engines. Mostly composition — no new detection. This is the sales-demonstration artifact.

### S2.4 — Detection depth, ROI order (D4 → D2/D3/D5 → D6 → C5/D7) ⬜ *(D4 + D5a + D5b + C5/D7-IDN shipped; D2/D3 deferred, D6 held for AI-cost decision, rest of C5/D7 remaining — see below)*
**Owner:** threat-intel-analyst + backend-engineer. Sequenced:
1. **D4 — "newly registered domain" signal** from the VirusTotal `creation_date` already
   on the wire (`feeds/virustotal.ts:58`). Cheapest, highest-ROI. ✅
2. **D2/D3/D5** — favicon-hash + JA3/JARM NEXUS lanes; convert clustering to
   connected-components; make `pivot_detected` fire on real infrastructure movement.
   - **D5a (connected-components) ✅** — `lib/cluster-components.ts` post-pass
     (union-find over specific-evidence bridges only: cert-serial/cert-SAN/per-IP;
     ASN/subnet/registrar are receive-only leaves) groups the six lanes'
     `infrastructure_clusters` rows into `component_id`s. Wired into both
     `agents/nexus.ts` and `workflows/nexusRun.ts`; migration `0240`. Additive —
     does not touch `threats.cluster_id` or the Attributor's `asns.length>=3` gate.
   - **D5b (pivot-on-movement) ✅** — `lib/cluster-infra-movement.ts`
     (`detectClusterInfraMovement()`) post-pass diffs each bridge-kind cluster's
     (cert-serial/cert-SAN/per-IP only, same parity rationale as D5a) infra
     fingerprint run-over-run and emits a second `pivot_detected` trigger
     (`payload_json.kind='infra_movement'`, alongside the existing `dormancy`
     kind — same event_type/target_agent, no new dispatch wiring) on genuine
     new-infra growth. Flood-controlled (prior-snapshot required, confidence
     >40 + hub exclusion, growth thresholds, 24h per-cluster cooldown, per-run
     cap of 5, over-cap skip). Migration `0241`. Additive — does not touch
     `threats.cluster_id` or the dormancy signal.
   - **D2 (favicon-hash) deferred** — needs a favicon-fetch/hash enrichment stage
     that doesn't exist yet; no lane can consume it until that stage ships.
   - **D3 (JA3/JARM) deferred** — infeasible on Cloudflare Workers: no raw
     TLS-handshake access, so JA3/JARM fingerprints can't be computed.
3. **D6** — page-content/visual phishing analysis.
4. **C5/D7** — breadth: Google Play parity, IDN/punycode homoglyphs, WHOIS registrant/NS,
   forum/Telegram dark-web.
   - ✅ **IDN/punycode homoglyph generation** shipped: `dnstwist.ts` now emits
     single-substitution Cyrillic/Greek confusable variants (curated `CONFUSABLES`
     map, punycode via the runtime `URL` API, bounded to ≤8/domain with reserved
     `typeOrder` slots), stored as `idn_homoglyph` with a readable `unicode_domain`
     (migration 0242) that drives alert titles. Deterministic, no AI, no new dep.
   - ⬜ Deferred (each its own increment, with a dependency): **WHOIS registrant/NS**
     (needs a per-domain RDAP enrichment + schema; registrant usually GDPR-redacted
     so NS/registrar is the key), **Google Play parity** (no free apps-by-developer
     API — needs a scraping/data-source decision), **forum/Telegram dark-web**
     (needs bot/API credentials + access infra).

---

## Wave 3 — Debt & hardening (P2/P3)

- **S3.1 (S3+S4)** — extract one shared `verifyOrgAccess` into `middleware/auth.ts`;
  reconcile the outer/inner org-net exemption sets (single "who is global-read" predicate).
- **S3.2 (S5, S6)** — blanket auth guard for `POST /api/internal/*`; declare `LRX_API_KEY`
  in the wrangler manifest; add `lrxradar.com` to CORS; fix the MCP TTL comment.
- **S3.3 (T2)** — stand up vitest for `averrow-tenant`; smoke-test billing + signals first.
- **S3.4 (T3, T4)** — split `handlers/admin.ts` by domain; unit-test the orchestrator
  hour-gate dispatch table.
- **S3.5 (T5, T6)** — finish R4/R7/R9 cleanup (ship-or-drop Modal; delete Dropdown/
  BottomSheet/`components/mobile`; migrate the 2 token stragglers); decide `observatory`
  vs `observatory-v3` before R10; either remove the retired-agent dispatch handlers or
  document each live CTA; scope an ESLint `no-explicit-any` gate to non-frozen dirs.
- **S3.6 (R4, R5)** — track the D1 read-budget trend; fix the wrangler CPU-limit and
  ct-monitor docblock drift.

## Trust Radar → Averrow rebrand (executed 2026-07-17) ✅

Out-of-band of the wave sequence above — a same-day structural rename, not a Wave 1
terminology/copy pass. Landed by a docs-maintainer sweep against a code change already
merged on this branch.

**Changed:**
- Backend package folder `packages/trust-radar` → `packages/averrow-worker`
  (`package.json` name: `averrow-worker`).
- Deployed Cloudflare Worker name `trust-radar` → `averrow`.
- GitHub repo `cleerox-svg/trust-radar` → `cleerox-svg/averrow`.
- Doc/comment display strings referencing "Trust Radar" the product and
  `packages/trust-radar/...` paths swept to "Averrow" / `packages/averrow-worker/...`
  across `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `RESTRUCTURE_SPEC.md`, `TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md`,
  `LRX_PRODUCT_BOUNDARIES.md`, `docs/AI_AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/THREAT_FEEDS.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/AGENT_STANDARD.md`,
  `docs/PLATFORM_DATA_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/CLAUDE_SUBAGENTS.md`,
  `docs/NOTIFICATIONS_AUDIT.md`, `docs/CATEGORY_RESEARCH.md`,
  `docs/EMAIL_SECURITY_ENGINE.md`, `docs/legal/DPA_DRAFT.md`,
  `docs/SEED_DOMAINS_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/EMAIL_ROUTING_RUNBOOK.md`,
  `docs/BIMI_SETUP_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/runbooks/*`,
  `.claude/agents/{backend-engineer,test-engineer,qa-verifier,legal-content-drafter}.md`,
  and the header comments of `scripts/platform-diagnostics.sh` +
  `scripts/dns-queue-stability-check.sh`.
- Outbound feed User-Agents already read `Averrow-ThreatIntel/1.0` / `Averrow/1.0`
  (verified in `packages/averrow-worker/src/feeds/*.ts` — no doc claimed otherwise, so
  no doc change was needed here, only confirmation for this record).

**Intentionally KEPT — deferred, with rationale (not oversights):**
1. **D1 database names** (`trust-radar-v2`, `trust-radar-v2-audit`,
   `trust-radar-dns-queue`), the **R2 bucket** (`trust-radar-trademark-assets`), and the
   **Analytics Engine dataset** (`trust_radar_d1_reads`). Renaming a live D1
   database/R2 bucket/AE dataset is a data migration (new resource + backfill + cutover),
   not a label edit — out of scope for a docs sweep and not requested. Every doc that
   names one of these now carries a one-line "kept intentionally" note instead of
   silently going stale next to the renamed package/Worker.
2. **Outbound webhook wire contract** (`lib/webhooks.ts`): HMAC headers
   `X-Trust-Radar-Signature` / `X-Trust-Radar-Event` / `X-Trust-Radar-Delivery` and the
   `TrustRadar-Webhook/1.0` User-Agent. These are a **customer-integration contract** —
   any subscriber that pins the header name or UA string breaks silently on a rename.
   Changing it needs a versioned/dual-emit rollout coordinated with webhook subscribers,
   not a docs edit.
3. **Frozen legacy `public/manifest.json`** (`packages/averrow-worker/public/`, the
   old-SPA tree CLAUDE.md §3 marks "NEVER MODIFY — frozen forever"): `"name": "Trust
   Radar"`, `"short_name": "TrustRadar"`. Left as-is because the file lives under the
   frozen `public/`/`app.js`/`styles.css` tree; overriding the freeze for this one field
   needs an explicit owner decision, not a docs-maintainer edit.
4. **`trustradar.ca` / `lrxradar.com` domains** — already documented in `README.md` §Domains
   as legacy, redirecting to `averrow.com`. Unrelated to the package/Worker rename;
   not touched.

**Pre-existing (unrelated) doc drift noticed, not fixed here:** `docs/NOTIFICATIONS_AUDIT.md`
cites `packages/averrow-worker/src/lib/email.ts` as "Resend wrapper" — no such file exists
(no single `lib/email.ts`; Resend calls are scattered across `briefing-email.ts`,
`invite-email.ts`, `magic-link-email.ts`, etc.) and `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` cited a
`TrustRadarAI` export from a `src/lib/ai-client.ts` that also doesn't exist (removed, the
stale mention was dropped rather than guessed at). Neither is a rebrand-caused break —
flagging for a follow-up doc-accuracy pass.

## Sequencing notes

- **Wave 0 is independent and parallelizable** — five disjoint-file sessions, fan out.
- **Wave 1** is copy/config heavy and can run alongside Wave 0 (different owners).
- **S2.1 blocks the public takedown metric in S1.5** — instrument before you market.
- **S2.2/S2.3 depend on the standing model staying intact** — do TK1 (S0.5) first so the
  audit trail is truthful before new submit paths are added.
- External/owner-gated (carried from June): APWG membership, Google Web Risk quota, Stripe
  products, MSA legal review.
