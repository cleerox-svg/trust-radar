# Architecture

Averrow is a monorepo-based platform built on Cloudflare Workers, D1, and KV. This document covers the system architecture, routing, data layer, and frontend serving strategy.

## Monorepo Structure

The repository uses Turborepo with pnpm workspaces. Configuration lives in `turbo.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at the root.

## Cloudflare Workers Architecture

### Entry Point

The main Worker is defined in `packages/trust-radar/src/index.ts`. It exports a standard Workers `fetch` handler along with a `scheduled` handler for cron-triggered feed ingestion.

### Router

The Worker uses [itty-router](https://github.com/kwhitley/itty-router) for HTTP routing. The router is instantiated at module scope and routes are registered declaratively:

```typescript
const router = Router();
router.options("*", handleOptions);           // CORS preflight
router.get("/health", handleHealthCheck);     // Health check
router.get("/api/auth/login", handleOAuthLogin); // Auth routes
// ... 100+ route registrations
```

Routes are organized into sections by feature area: Auth, Scans, Threats, Brands, Feeds, Agents, Email Security, Admin, etc.

### Request Flow

1. Incoming request hits the Worker `fetch` handler
2. Hostname-based routing checks for honeypot domains first
3. The itty-router matches the request path and method
4. Middleware runs (auth, rate limiting) as inline checks
5. Handler function executes and returns a JSON response
6. Security headers are applied via `applySecurityHeaders()`
7. If no API route matches, the request falls through to SPA asset serving

### Authentication

Authentication uses JWT tokens issued via Google OAuth. Three auth levels exist:

- `requireAuth` — Any authenticated user
- `requireAdmin` — Admin role required
- `requireSuperAdmin` — Super-admin role required

Auth middleware is in `packages/trust-radar/src/middleware/auth.ts`. JWT verification uses `packages/trust-radar/src/lib/jwt.ts`.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting uses KV-based counters, implemented in `packages/trust-radar/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`. Different rate limit buckets exist for `auth`, `scan`, and general API usage.

## Database: Cloudflare D1

Trust Radar uses two D1 databases:

| Binding | Database | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `DB` | `trust-radar-v2` | Primary data (threats, brands, feeds, users, agents) |
| `AUDIT_DB` | `trust-radar-v2-audit` | Audit log (admin actions, session events) |

### D1 Sessions API (Read Replicas)

Read-heavy endpoints use the D1 Sessions API to route queries to read replicas, reducing latency and offloading the primary. The implementation lives in `packages/trust-radar/src/lib/db.ts`:

- `getDbContext(request)` — returns a session-aware DB handle from the incoming request's `x-d1-bookmark` header
- `getReadSession(env, ctx)` — returns a read-only session for cron/agent contexts without an HTTP request
- `attachBookmark(response, session)` — attaches the session bookmark to the response for client-side session continuity

Endpoints using read replicas: Dashboard overview, Brands list, Providers list/v2, Observatory (all 5 endpoints), Threats list, Operations list, Agents list.

Write operations (threat ingestion, agent runs, brand monitoring) always use the primary `env.DB` handle directly.

### OLAP Cube Tables

Three pre-aggregated cube tables accelerate UI queries that would otherwise require full `GROUP BY` scans on the 113K+ row `threats` table:

| Table | Primary Key | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `threat_cube_geo` | `(hour_bucket, lat_bucket, lng_bucket, country_code, threat_type, severity, source_feed)` | Geographic aggregates |
| `threat_cube_provider` | `(hour_bucket, hosting_provider_id, threat_type, severity, source_feed)` | Provider aggregates |
| `threat_cube_brand` | `(hour_bucket, target_brand_id, threat_type, severity, source_feed)` | Brand aggregates |

Each cube stores `threat_count` and `updated_at` per dimension combination per hour bucket. Cubes are maintained by:

1. **Navigator agent** (every 5 min cron) — rebuilds current + previous hour via `INSERT OR REPLACE ... SELECT ... GROUP BY`
2. **cube-healer agent** (every 6 hours) — full 30-day bulk rebuild to fix retroactive enrichment drift
3. **admin cube-backfill** endpoint — manual backfill for new cubes or recovery

Cubes use `INSERT OR REPLACE` which is idempotent — overlapping rebuilds are safe.

### Pre-computed Columns

Key tables carry denormalized aggregate columns to avoid JOINs to `threats`:

- `brands.threat_count`, `brands.last_threat_seen` — maintained by feed ingestion and brand-match backfill
- `hosting_providers.active_threat_count`, `hosting_providers.total_threat_count`, `hosting_providers.trend_7d`, `hosting_providers.trend_30d` — maintained by provider stats refresh

### Schema Overview

Migrations are in `packages/trust-radar/migrations/` (88+ migration files). Key tables:

- `threats` — Core threat intelligence records (URL, domain, IP, severity, source)
- `brands` — Monitored brands with canonical domains and threat counts
- `feed_configs` / `feed_status` — Feed ingestion configuration and health
- `users` / `sessions` — User accounts and active sessions
- `agent_outputs` / `agent_runs` — AI agent execution logs
- `campaigns` — Correlated threat campaigns
- `hosting_providers` — Provider reputation tracking
- `email_security_scans` — Email security posture scan results
- `spam_trap_captures` — Spam trap catch records
- `notifications` — User notification queue
- `sales_leads` — Prospector-generated sales leads
- `social_monitor_results` — Social monitoring scan results
- `social_monitor_schedule` — Social monitoring job scheduling
- `brand_profiles` — Brand profile definitions
- `lookalike_domains` — Detected lookalike/typosquat domains
- `ct_certificates` — Certificate Transparency log entries
- `threat_narratives` — AI-generated threat narrative summaries
- `contact_submissions` — Inbound contact form submissions
- `alerts` — Alert rules and delivery tracking
- `organizations` — Multi-tenant organization records
- `threat_cube_geo` — OLAP cube: hourly geo-aggregated threat counts
- `threat_cube_provider` — OLAP cube: hourly provider-aggregated threat counts
- `threat_cube_brand` — OLAP cube: hourly brand-aggregated threat counts

### Migration Naming

Migrations follow the pattern `XXXX_description.sql` with sequential numbering (0001 through 0088+).

## Caching: Cloudflare KV

KV namespace bound as `CACHE` is used for:

- **IOC deduplication** — `dedup:{type}:{value}` keys with 24-hour TTL prevent duplicate threat insertion during feed ingestion
- **Email security scan caching** — `email-sec:{domain}` keys cache scan results for 1 hour
- **Rate limiting** — Per-IP counters for API rate limiting
- **Honeypot site content** — `honeypot-site:{hostname}:{page}` stores generated honeypot HTML
- **Session invalidation** — Forced logout flags checked during auth
- **Page-load endpoint caching** — JSON responses for heavy page-load endpoints, pre-warmed by Navigator agent every 5 minutes

### KV Cache Strategy (Page-Load Endpoints)

All high-traffic page-load endpoints check KV before querying D1. Cache keys encode query parameters for proper invalidation. Standard TTL is 300s (5 min). All cached read endpoints use D1 read replicas via `getReadSession()` and parallelize list + stats queries via `Promise.all()`.

| Cache Key Pattern | TTL | Endpoint |
|-------------------|-----|----------|
| `observatory_nodes:{period}:{source}` | 300s | Observatory nodes |
| `observatory_arcs:{period}:{source}` | 300s | Observatory arcs (single time-filtered query, no fallback) |
| `observatory_stats:{period}:{source}` | 300s | Observatory stats |
| `observatory_live:{source}:{limit}` | 120s | Observatory live feed |
| `observatory_operations:{status}:{limit}` | 300s | Observatory operations |
| `dashboard_overview:{scopeHash}` | 300s | Dashboard overview |
| `dashboard_top_brands:{limit}:{scopeHash}` | 300s | Dashboard top brands |
| `agents_list` | 300s | Agents list |
| `operations_list:{status}:{limit}:{offset}` | 300s | Operations list |
| `operations_stats` | 300s | Operations stats |
| `brand_list:{tab}:{sort}:{limit}:{scopeHash}` | 300s | Brands list (default view, reduced-cardinality key) |
| `brand_stats:{scopeHash}` | 300s | Brand stats |
| `providers_v2:{country}:{status}:{sort}:{limit}` | 300s | Providers v2 list (default view, reduced-cardinality key) |
| `providers_intelligence` | 300s | Provider intelligence |
| `threat_actors:{limit}:{offset}:{filters...}` | 300s | Threat actors list (read replicas, parallel queries) |
| `threat_actor_stats` | 300s | Threat actor stats (parallel 6-query aggregation) |
| `breaches:{limit}:{q}` | 300s | Breach checks (read replicas, parallel queries) |
| `ato_events:{limit}:{status}` | 300s | ATO events (read replicas, parallel queries) |
| `email_auth:{limit}:{domain}` | 300s | Email auth reports (read replicas, parallel queries) |
| `cloud_incidents:{limit}:{provider}:{active}` | 300s | Cloud incidents (read replicas, parallel queries) |

Default page loads (no search, no filter, page 1) use reduced-dimension cache keys for higher hit rates. Filtered/paginated views use full-dimension keys.

### Cache Pre-Warming (Navigator)

The Navigator agent (every 5 minutes) pre-warms KV caches by calling handler functions with synthetic requests. This ensures users never hit a cold cache on the most critical pages (24 endpoints across 3 phases):

- **Phase A** (always): Observatory nodes, arcs, stats for all 3 periods (7d, 24h, 30d) + live + operations (11 endpoints)
- **Phase B** (if CPU budget allows): Dashboard overview + top-brands, Agents list, Operations list + stats (5 endpoints)
- **Phase C** (if CPU budget allows): Brands list + stats, Threat Actors list + stats, Breaches, ATO events, Email auth, Cloud incidents (8 endpoints)

## SPA Frontend Serving

The Worker serves the frontend SPA using Cloudflare Workers Static Assets:

```toml
# wrangler.toml
[assets]
directory = "./public"
binding = "ASSETS"
not_found_handling = "404-page"
```

All requests pass through the Worker first, enabling API routing. The `not_found_handling = "404-page"` setting returns a 404 for any path not matching an API route or static file.

## Durable Objects

The `ThreatPushHub` Durable Object (`packages/trust-radar/src/durableObjects/ThreatPushHub.ts`) manages WebSocket connections for real-time threat push notifications. When new threats are ingested, the feed runner broadcasts events to all connected browser sessions.

## Cron Triggers

The Worker has multiple cron triggers configured in `wrangler.toml`:

| Cron | Handler | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `*/5 * * * *` | `navigator` | DNS geo-backfill (200 domains), OLAP cube refresh (6 cubes), KV cache pre-warming (24 endpoints) |
| `*/15 * * * *` | `orchestrator` | Threat feed scan, Cartographer enrichment (dispatched as Workflow), agent scheduling |
| `12 */6 * * *` | `cube-healer` | Full 30-day bulk rebuild of all 3 cube tables to fix retroactive drift |

### Orchestrator (`src/cron/orchestrator.ts`)

Routes jobs by time of day:
- Every 15 min: Threat feed scan (Sentinel)
- Every 15 min: Cartographer enrichment (dispatched as `CartographerBackfillWorkflow`)
- Every 4 hours: NEXUS clustering (dispatched as `NexusWorkflow`)
- Every 30 min: Analyst brand attribution (via `ctx.waitUntil`)
- Every 6 hours: Strategist campaign correlation (via `ctx.waitUntil`)
- Daily: Observer briefings, Pathfinder lead generation
- Weekly: Prospector sales intelligence

### Navigator (`src/cron/navigator.ts`)

Independent agent — runs on the `*/5 * * * *` cron. Not managed by Flight Control
(FC monitors its health but does not dispatch it). Previously known as `fast_tick`;
historical `agent_runs` rows carry `agent_id='fast_tick'` while new runs write
`agent_id='navigator'`. 5 phases per run:
1. **Event drain** — Marks stale pending `agent_events` (>5 min old) as done (up to 50 events)
2. **DNS backfill** — Runs domain geo-enrichment batch (200 domains, 8s timeout)
3. **Cube refresh** — Rebuilds current + previous hour for `threat_cube_geo`, `threat_cube_provider`, `threat_cube_brand` (6 builds total)
4. **Cache pre-warming** — Phase A (Observatory 3 periods), Phase B (Dashboard/Agents/Operations), Phase C (Brands/Threat Actors/Intel) — 24 endpoints total
5. **Logging** — Writes `agent_runs` record with timing, cube row counts, and error summary

### Cloudflare Workflows

Heavy agents are dispatched as durable Workflows to avoid blocking the cron mesh:

- `CartographerBackfillWorkflow` — Multi-step enrichment with retry and checkpointing
- `NexusWorkflow` — Clustering analysis with durable execution context

Workflows run in their own execution context with no CPU time ceiling, unlike cron which shares the 30s Worker limit.

## Email Handling

The Worker receives inbound emails for two purposes:

- **DMARC reports** — Processed by `packages/trust-radar/src/dmarc-receiver.ts`
- **Spam trap captures** — Processed by `packages/trust-radar/src/spam-trap.ts`

## Environments

Three environments are configured in `wrangler.toml`:

| Environment | Domain | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Production | `averrow.com` | Live platform |
| Staging | `staging.averrow.com` | Pre-production testing |
| Dev | Local | Local development with wrangler dev |
