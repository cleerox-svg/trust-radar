# Notifications Audit & Redesign — Phase N0

**Status:** draft
**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Standard:** none yet — this audit produces the first one.
**Pattern:** mirrors [`AGENT_AUDIT.md`](./AGENT_AUDIT.md).

The first concrete read of the platform's notifications system against
the operator's lived complaints. For each issue: where in the code,
what's broken, what to do about it. For each redesign principle:
which industry pattern it derives from + what we're adopting.

This document is the sign-off artifact. Phases N1-N6 act on the
verdicts here.

## Headline findings

1. **`email_security_change` has no dedup** — `cartographer.ts:626` calls `createNotification` without `metadata`, so the dedup gate's `getRateKey()` returns `null` and skips. Every cartographer tick that re-evaluates a brand can fire a fresh row. This is the "Voximplant ×3, MI314 ×3, Pitt ×3" the operator screenshotted.
2. **No tenant scoping anywhere** — the `notifications` table has no `brand_id` / `org_id` columns. The LIST endpoint filters by `user_id` only. When `createNotification()` is called without an explicit `userId`, it broadcasts to every active user across every tenant via `SELECT id FROM users WHERE status = 'active'` (`lib/notifications.ts:98`). 5 of the 8 declared types fan out this way today.
3. **Click is a dead end** — `NotificationBell.tsx:54-90` and `Notifications.tsx:319-370` fetch the `link` field but never use it. Click only fires `markRead`. The `link` is plumbed through the API and ignored at the leaf.
4. **Settings are shallow** — `NotificationPreferences.tsx` has 5 type toggles + push toggle + quiet hours. No per-brand mute, no severity floor, no digest mode, no per-channel routing.
5. **State model is binary `read / unread`** — no snooze, no done, no triage workflow. Operators end up with a 1229-alert badge they can never zero out.
6. **AI intel doesn't reach notifications** — Narrator, Observer, Strategist, NEXUS all produce useful intel that sits in `agent_outputs` and never reaches the bell. No predictive alerts, no cross-brand patterns, no recommended-action framing.
7. **Platform health signals don't reach notifications either** — D1 budget approaching the 95% skip threshold, feeds entering at-risk, agents stalled, FC failing to recover, briefing cron not firing — operators discover these only by running diagnostics manually.
8. **Email briefing has been silently broken** — the daily 13:00 UTC cron-driven briefing email hasn't been delivering. Most likely cause: `RESEND_API_KEY` rotation, or a stuck `emailed=1` row dedup-skipping subsequent days. Current code logs the failure as a warning and the cron tick still reports success — silent.

## 1. Methodology

Read every `createNotification()` call site in the worker, the LIST
endpoint that powers the bell, the React components that render
notifications, and the migration that defines the schema. Cross-
referenced against the operator's screenshot showing 1229 alerts +
377 unread + 99+ on the bell, with the same brand's "email security
improved" appearing 3× in a row.

Sources walked:

- `packages/trust-radar/src/lib/notifications.ts` (creation + dedup)
- `packages/trust-radar/src/handlers/notifications.ts` (LIST / read endpoints)
- `packages/trust-radar/migrations/0018_notifications.sql` (schema)
- `packages/trust-radar/migrations/0107_notifications_schema_check.sql` (type CHECK constraint)
- `packages/shared/src/notification-events.ts` (declared type registry; deleted in earlier rebase, now in averrow-ui)
- `packages/averrow-ui/src/lib/notification-events.ts` (current registry)
- `packages/averrow-ui/src/components/NotificationBell.tsx` (bell + dropdown)
- `packages/averrow-ui/src/features/settings/Notifications.tsx` (all-notifications page)
- `packages/averrow-ui/src/features/settings/NotificationPreferences.tsx` (settings)
- `packages/averrow-ui/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts` (TanStack hooks)
- All call sites of `createNotification()` across the worker — 18 in total.

Industry research (§6) draws on Linear, GitHub, Slack, PagerDuty,
Stripe, plus Apple HIG and Android Notification Channels. Sources
cited inline.

The audit is read-only. Phases N1–N6 act on the verdicts.

## 2. Per-type findings (current state)

Eight notification types are declared in the type CHECK constraint
(migration 0107) + the registry. Status column reflects whether the
type works as intended end-to-end, including dedup and tenant scope:

| Type | Where created (file:line) | Dedup window + key | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand_threat` | `feeds/certstream.ts:185`, `dmarc-receiver.ts:509` | 1h + `brand_id` | ⚠ partial — dedup works; broadcast (no `userId`) sends to every active user across every tenant |
| `campaign_escalation` | `agents/strategist.ts:152, 216` | 6h + `campaign_id` | ⚠ partial — dedup works; broadcast |
| `feed_health` | `lib/feedRunner.ts:234, 382` | 1h + `feed_name` | ✅ works — system-wide visibility is intentional |
| `intelligence_digest` | `agents/observer.ts:821` | 24h + **NONE** | ⚠ partial — no `metadata` key; dedup falls back to type-only (silent no-op) + broadcast |
| `agent_milestone` | `agents/strategist.ts:216` | 1h + `campaign_id` | ⚠ partial — dedup works; broadcast |
| `email_security_change` | `agents/cartographer.ts:626` | 6h declared + **NONE** passed | ❌ broken — no `metadata` argument means the dedup gate's `getRateKey()` returns `null` and no rate row is inserted; every cartographer tick can re-fire |
| `circuit_breaker_tripped` | `agents/flightControl.ts:1229`, `lib/agentRunner.ts:586` | 1h + `agent_id` | ⚠ partial — dedup works; broadcast |
| `feed_auto_paused` (declared in registry, never INSERTed) | — | — | ❌ broken — declared as a system event but no `createNotification()` call site fires it; also fails the type CHECK constraint as written |

### Specific defects

**1. `cartographer.ts:626` — the broken `email_security_change` call**

```typescript
await createNotification(env, {
  type: 'email_security_change',
  title: `${brandName?.name ?? brand.domain} email security ${dropped ? 'degraded' : 'improved'}`,
  message: `Grade changed from ${brand.existing_grade} to ${result.grade}`,
  severity: dropped ? 'high' : 'info',
});
```

No `userId` (broadcasts) + no `metadata` (dedup gate skipped) + no
`link` (dead-end click). Also no policy on what counts as a
notification-worthy grade change — F→D and F→A both fire identical
spam-density rows.

**2. `dmarc-receiver.ts:509` — half-fixed**

```typescript
await createNotification(env, {
  type: "brand_threat",
  severity: failRate > 0.5 ? "critical" : "high",
  title: `DMARC failures detected for ${report.domain}`,
  message: `${failPct}% of ${emailCount.toLocaleString()} emails failed DMARC — reported by ${report.reporter_org}`,
  metadata: { brand_id: String(brandId), domain: report.domain },
});
```

Has `metadata.brand_id` (so dedup works) but no `userId` (broadcasts
to every active user) + no `link` (dead-end click).

**3. Broadcast call sites — all 5 types that fan out to every tenant**

- `agents/cartographer.ts:626` — `email_security_change`
- `agents/observer.ts:821` — `intelligence_digest`
- `agents/strategist.ts:152, 216` — `campaign_escalation` / `agent_milestone`
- `agents/flightControl.ts:1229` — `circuit_breaker_tripped`
- `lib/agentRunner.ts:586` — `circuit_breaker_tripped`
- `dmarc-receiver.ts:509` — `brand_threat`

**4. `feeds/certstream.ts:185` — the only one with `userId` + `link`**

```typescript
await createNotification(ctx.env, {
  type: 'brand_threat',
  severity: 'high',
  title,
  message,
  link: `/brands/${brandId}`,
  metadata: { brand_id: brandId, count: info.count },
});
```

Reference shape: tenant-scoped (per-brand notification routed by
brand_id → monitored_brands → user lookup) + carries a useful link.
This is the shape every type should converge on.

---

## 3. Tenant scoping audit

### 3.1 LIST endpoint SQL (`handlers/notifications.ts:68-94`)

```sql
SELECT id, type, severity, title, message, link, read_at, created_at, metadata
  FROM notifications
  WHERE user_id = ?
    [AND read_at IS NULL]
    [AND type = ?]
    [AND severity = ?]
    [AND (LOWER(title) LIKE ? OR LOWER(message) LIKE ?)]
    [AND created_at < ?]
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT ?
```

The query is correct **for what's there** — but the schema gives
nothing else to scope by. No `brand_id`. No `org_id`. No
`audience` field. Tenant scoping is entirely a function of which
`user_id` rows the broadcast loop wrote.

### 3.2 The broadcast fan-out (`lib/notifications.ts:93-101`)

```typescript
let userIds: string[];
if (opts.userId) {
  userIds = [opts.userId];
} else {
  const users = await db.prepare(
    "SELECT id FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"
  ).all<{ id: string }>();
  userIds = users.results.map(u => u.id);
}
// ... loop INSERTs one row per userId
```

When called without `userId`, this writes one row per active user
in the entire platform. With ~N tenants × ~M users per tenant ×
~K active brands per tenant, every cartographer email-grade tick
writes N×M rows — even though only the brand's owners care.

### 3.3 The schema (`migrations/0018_notifications.sql`, replaced by `0107`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id      TEXT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type         TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ( ... )),
  severity     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'info',
  title        TEXT NOT NULL,
  message      TEXT NOT NULL,
  link         TEXT,
  read_at      TEXT,
  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  metadata     TEXT
);
```

Missing for tenant scoping:
- `brand_id` (queryable; today brand_id is buried in `metadata` JSON)
- `org_id` (zero presence in the schema)
- `audience` enum (`tenant` / `super_admin` / `all` / `team`) so the LIST endpoint can route correctly
- `state` enum (`unread` / `read` / `snoozed` / `done`) — see §4 + §7
- `reason_text` ("you monitor Acme") + `recommended_action` ("rotate DKIM")
- `group_key` for entity collapsing (one expandable row instead of three)

§10 lists every column the redesigned schema will carry.

### 3.4 Super_admin behaviour today

Super_admins are not special-cased anywhere in the LIST endpoint.
A super_admin sees only the rows tagged with their own `user_id`.
Operationally significant signals (cron skipping pre-warms, feeds
auto-pausing, agent circuit breakers tripping) reach the bell only
because the call site happens to broadcast to all active users —
super_admins are caught in the broadcast incidentally, not because
the design routes operational notifications to them.

That coincidence breaks under tenant scoping (§3.2 fix removes the
broadcast). Without explicit super_admin routing, the operational
alerts stop reaching the operator. This is what §13 (platform-
health signals) addresses.

---

## 4. Click destination audit

### 4.1 The `link` field exists end-to-end

- Schema: `migrations/0018_notifications.sql:14` declares `link TEXT`
- `lib/notifications.ts` accepts it on the create call
- `handlers/notifications.ts:71` returns it on every LIST row
- `hooks/useNotifications.ts` plumbs it through TanStack Query
- React components destructure it in their `Notification` type

…and then **never use it**. Click is a dead end at the leaf.

### 4.2 `NotificationBell.tsx:54-90`

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => onRead(notification.id)}
  // ...
>
  {/* renders title, message, type, severity, created_at —
      never touches notification.link */}
</button>
```

Single click handler: `markRead`. No navigation. No expanded view.
No context menu. The user dismisses by reading; if they want to act
on a notification they have to navigate to the relevant page
themselves and find the right entity.

### 4.3 `Notifications.tsx:319-370` (All Notifications page)

Same anti-pattern — the row is a `<button>` whose onClick fires
`markRead`. No link navigation, no expand, no action menu.

### 4.4 Population of `link` per type

| Type | `link` populated? |
|---|---|
| `brand_threat` (certstream) | ✅ `/brands/${brandId}` |
| `brand_threat` (dmarc) | ❌ null |
| `campaign_escalation` | ✅ `/campaigns/${campaignId}` |
| `feed_health` | ✅ `/admin/feeds` |
| `intelligence_digest` | ❌ null |
| `agent_milestone` | ✅ `/agents` |
| `email_security_change` | ❌ null |
| `circuit_breaker_tripped` | ✅ `/admin/agents` (FC) / `/admin/budget` (sub-call) |

Even where `link` is populated correctly, the UI ignores it. Even
where the UI ignored a valid link, half of the types don't bother
to populate it. Both ends are broken.

### 4.5 What "click" should do (research-derived; see §6)

1. Click → navigate to `link`. Mark read in the same operation.
2. If notification has an explicit `recommended_action` (§7), the
   action button label changes from "Open" to e.g. "Rotate DKIM".
3. Right-click / kebab menu offers: Snooze (1h / 24h / 7d), Mark
   done, Mute this type, Mute this brand.
4. Bulk-select for batch dismiss / batch mark done.

## 5. Settings audit

### 5.1 `NotificationPreferences.tsx` — current toggles

| Preference | Granularity | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Threats | global per user | on |
| Campaign Escalations | global per user | on |
| Feed Health Alerts | global per user | on |
| Intelligence Digests | global per user | on |
| Agent Milestones | global per user | on |
| Push notifications | binary on/off + device list | off (until prompted) |
| Quiet hours start | wall clock | 22:00 |
| Quiet hours end | wall clock | 07:00 |
| Quiet hours timezone | IANA tz | user's browser tz |
| Critical bypasses quiet hours | binary | on |

That's 5 type toggles + 1 push toggle + 4 quiet-hours fields.
Total dimensions: 7 of the 8 declared types are togglable
(`circuit_breaker_tripped` isn't; it's a system event), and that's
the only axis exposed to the user.

### 5.2 What's missing

- **Per-brand** mute / watch / ignore (the GitHub model — pick
  which brands you care about; default behaviour for brands you
  don't watch falls back to a severity floor).
- **Per-severity floor** ("only notify me ≥ high" or "only
  notify me ≥ critical for brands I don't actively watch").
- **Digest mode** (realtime / hourly / daily / weekly). Most non-
  critical types are perfect candidates for daily summary instead
  of per-event firehose.
- **Per-channel routing** (in-app / push / email / SMS). Today
  it's "push on/off"; granular routing per type per severity is
  table stakes for an alerting system.
- **Snooze defaults** ("when I snooze, default 24h not 1h").
- **Super_admin firehose toggle** (Q3 in the operator's
  decisions log) — a super_admin should see operational
  notifications by default and choose to opt into tenant traffic.
- **Notification rules / filters** (Slack/Linear pattern):
  user-defined "if type=X and severity≥Y and brand=Z, route to
  channel C with priority P". Power-user feature for ops teams.

### 5.3 Schema gap

The current `notification_preferences` table (defined in the same
0018 migration block; see `handlers/notifications.ts:184-282` for
the read/write paths) is one row per user with a flat set of
columns matching the toggles above. It cannot express any of the
missing dimensions in §5.2 without schema changes — not just per-
brand, but per-channel and digest mode.

§10 introduces `notification_subscriptions` (one row per
user × brand) and a richer `notification_preferences_v2` (digest
mode, channel routing, severity floors).

---

## 6. Industry research

What "excellent" looks like, with specific patterns and the concrete
adoption call. Sources cited inline.

### 6.1 Linear — inbox + state machine

Linear treats notifications as a triage queue, not a feed. The
inbox view sits as a primary navigation item next to "My Issues"
and is the surface engineers visit first thing in the morning.

Pattern: every notification has an explicit state — `unread`,
`read`, `snoozed`, `done`. `done` is **not** the same as `read`.
You read a notification to clear the badge; you mark it `done` to
say "I've acted on this". Snoozed notifications disappear until a
chosen time, then reappear in `unread`. Linear also offers **mute**
at the source level (the issue, the project) so you stop receiving
events without losing the existing pile.

Each row carries a **reason badge** ("you were assigned", "you
subscribed to this issue", "you're a project member") so you never
ask "why am I seeing this?".

**What we adopt:**

- 4-state machine on the row (`unread → read → snoozed → done`).
  The operator picked Q1=a; this matches.
- Required `reason_text` field on every notification row.
- Bulk operations on the inbox (mark-all-done, bulk-snooze).
- Inbox is a primary nav item, not a hidden bell — see §9 (Phase
  N4).

### 6.2 GitHub — Watching / Participating / Ignored

GitHub's per-repo subscription model is the standard for "scope
your firehose to what you care about":

- **Watching**: you receive every event in this repo.
- **Participating**: you receive events for issues / PRs you're
  actively involved in (commented, mentioned, assigned, authored).
- **Ignored**: you receive nothing, including @-mentions.
- **Custom**: subscribe only to specific event types (releases,
  security alerts, etc.).

Each notification carries a **reason badge** like Linear's:
`Mention`, `Author`, `Review request`, `Assigned`, `Subscribed`,
`Manual`, `Security alert`. The reason makes it possible to filter
the inbox ("show only mentions").

GitHub also offers per-thread unsubscribe — the notification itself
has an "Unsubscribe from this thread" link in the footer, so you can
cull noise without leaving the email / inbox view.

**What we adopt:**

- Per-brand subscription with three levels (`watching` / `default`
  / `ignored`). The operator picked Q2=b ("Critical+High by
  default") which we map to: brands the user monitors → `default`
  level (sees critical+high) until they change it; brands they
  don't monitor → no subscription row → no notifications at all.
- "Watching" gets all severities for that brand.
- "Ignored" mutes everything for that brand including critical
  (with a sticky warning banner so the user knows what they've
  silenced).
- Per-thread unsubscribe — every notification row gets a "mute
  this brand" / "mute this type" affordance.
- Reason badges (`Brand Threat`, `Campaign`, `Health`, `Intel`,
  `Action Required`).

### 6.3 Slack — per-channel granularity + keyword routing

Slack's notification model is the most granular in widespread use.
Three independent dimensions:

1. **Per-channel notification level**: `All new messages`,
   `Mentions only`, `Nothing`, `Default` (inherits workspace).
2. **Keyword highlighting**: arbitrary user-defined strings that
   trigger a notification regardless of channel level.
3. **Workspace-level overrides**: mobile vs desktop independently;
   "Notify me on mobile only when I'm not active on desktop".

The killer feature is **keyword routing** — power users define
"page me on PROD-OUTAGE" or "alert on $brand-name" and the same
substrate covers both casual chat and operational on-call.

**What we adopt:**

- Per-type granularity (we already have this; just need to
  preserve it).
- **Keyword routing for power users** — schedule for §14
  backlog rather than v1, but call it out so the schema doesn't
  paint us into a corner.
- **Channel routing** — every preference row should specify which
  delivery channels (in-app / push / email / SMS) get which types
  at which severity floors. Not all users want everything in their
  inbox AND on their phone AND in email.

### 6.4 PagerDuty / Opsgenie — operational alerts

The operational alerting world (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps)
established the standard pattern for "this matters NOW vs this can
wait":

- **Severity tiers** drive routing: P1 (critical) → page on-call
  via SMS + phone call + push. P2 (high) → push + email. P3-P5 →
  email or in-app only.
- **State machine**: `triggered` → `acknowledged` → `resolved`.
  Acknowledgement is **mandatory** for high-severity. If not
  ACKed within N minutes the system **escalates** to the next
  on-call.
- **Alert grouping**: the same monitor firing 50 times in 5 minutes
  becomes ONE incident with 50 events attached, not 50 incidents.
  Without grouping, paging behaviour breaks under load.
- **Maintenance windows**: planned downtime suppresses alerts for
  named services + named time ranges so deploys don't wake people.
- **Escalation policies**: "if the primary on-call doesn't ACK in 5
  minutes, page the secondary; in 15 minutes, page the manager".

**What we adopt:**

- Severity-driven channel routing (§5.2 / §10's
  `notification_preferences_v2`). Critical bypasses quiet hours
  and goes everywhere; medium goes in-app + digest only.
- **Group key** field on every notification row so 3 changes to
  Acme within 1h collapse into one expandable inbox entry.
- Escalation policies are a power-user feature — out of scope for
  v1, parked in §14. The schema's `audience` field + group_key
  mechanics don't preclude adding them later.
- **No mandatory ACK in v1**: we'd need an on-call concept first.
  But the `done` state in our 4-state machine maps cleanly to
  "operationally acknowledged" once we add ops semantics.

### 6.5 Stripe / GitHub / AWS — digest emails

Three different products converged on the same pattern: realtime
push only for critical, everything else rolled up. Stripe's daily
"Activity for [account]" email summarises the previous day's
charges, refunds, disputes in one digestible block. GitHub's
"Daily digest" rolls up all subscribed-thread activity into one
email per day (configurable to weekly). AWS's "Health Dashboard"
goes further — it generates a per-region weekly digest with AI-
summarised bullet points.

The pattern works because:
- Realtime is reserved for events the user genuinely cannot wait on
  (failed charge, security alert, system outage).
- Bundling reduces the cognitive cost of "what happened today?"
  from 50 emails to 1.
- Digest emails carry the same `link` to the relevant in-app view,
  so users can click through if a roll-up entry needs attention.

**What we adopt:**

- **Digest mode** as a per-user preference: `realtime`, `hourly`,
  `daily`, `weekly`. Default to `realtime` for critical+, `daily`
  for medium+, drop low entirely (per-user opt-in).
- Digest delivery is its own type (`notification_digest`), not a
  rollup of the underlying type rows. The digest email body
  enumerates the items but the items are still separately
  navigable in the in-app inbox.
- AI-summarised digests are deferred to Phase Q5b
  (`notification_narrator` sync agent). The digest layout works
  without AI — bulleted entries with severity, brand, and link.

### 6.6 iOS — notification interruption levels

iOS 15+ introduced `UNNotificationInterruptionLevel` as a 4-tier
spectrum that determines how aggressively a notification can
interrupt the user. The OS treats them differently:

| Level | Bypasses Focus? | Sound | Locked screen | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `passive` | no | none | shows in history only | low-importance roll-ups |
| `active` (default) | no | yes (user-configurable) | yes | most notifications |
| `time-sensitive` | partial — bypasses Focus *if user opts in per-app* | yes | yes | events tied to a deadline (delivery, ride, OTP) |
| `critical` | **always**; bypasses Focus + Do Not Disturb | yes (forced) | yes | safety alerts (medical, security, weather emergencies) |

`critical` requires Apple-granted entitlement; not available to most
apps. `time-sensitive` is broadly available and is the right level
for "this matters within the next hour".

**What we adopt:**

- Map our severity to iOS levels in the PWA notification helper:
  - `info` → `passive`
  - `low` → `active`
  - `medium` → `active`
  - `high` → `time-sensitive`
  - `critical` → `time-sensitive` (we cannot reliably get
    `critical` entitlement; users who want bypass can configure
    Focus exemption per-app).
- Honour the user's quiet hours in our preferences as a hard rule
  except when the user has explicitly enabled "critical bypasses
  quiet hours" (Q3 in §8) — match iOS's "Allow Time-Sensitive"
  per-app toggle.

### 6.7 Android — notification channels

Android 8+ requires every notification to belong to a
**notification channel**. The user (not the developer) controls
each channel's sound, vibration, lock-screen visibility, and
importance. Apps cannot bypass the user's channel settings.

The mental model: each channel is a category the user can
configure independently. WhatsApp creates `Messages` (high
importance), `Group Notifications` (medium), `Other` (low). Slack
creates one channel per workspace. Gmail creates one per IMAP
label.

**What we adopt:**

- Define notification channels matching our type registry in the
  PWA service worker:
  - `Brand Threats` (high importance)
  - `Campaign Escalations` (high)
  - `Intelligence Digests` (medium)
  - `Agent Milestones` (low)
  - `Email Security Changes` (low)
  - `Platform Health` (high — super_admin only)
  - `Operational Alerts` (max — feed health, FC alerts; super_admin)
- The user's channel settings on Android override our default
  importance. We declare the **starting importance** per channel
  and respect what the user configures.
- One-time channel creation in the SW install handler. Adding new
  channels later requires a service-worker update.

### 6.8 PWA + native — notification action buttons

Both iOS PWA notifications and Android `Notification.Action` allow
inline action buttons that the user can tap without opening the
app. The W3C Web Push API's `actions` array supports up to 2
buttons on iOS, 3 on Android, each with an `action` ID + label +
icon.

Common patterns:

- "Acknowledge" + "Snooze 1h"
- "Open" + "Dismiss"
- "Approve" + "Reject" (for approval queues — see Phase 5.4)

The action handler runs in the service worker `notificationclick`
event, so it can hit a backend API endpoint without launching the
PWA. This is the difference between "I have to open the app to act
on this" and "I can dismiss it from the lockscreen".

**What we adopt:**

- Every push notification carries 1-2 inline actions:
  - severity ≥ high: `Open` + `Snooze 1h`
  - severity ≤ medium: `Open` + `Done`
  - intel digest: `View digest` + `Snooze 24h`
- The `notificationclick` handler in the SW posts to
  `/api/notifications/:id/action` with the chosen action ID,
  authenticating via the same JWT the PWA uses for fetch calls.
- Action handlers update the `state` column directly (snooze
  sets `snoozed_until`, done sets `done_at`).

### 6.9 Summary — patterns → redesign principles

Maps each adopted pattern to the redesign principle in §7 it drives,
and the phase in §9 where it lands.

## 7. Redesign principles

Eight principles. Every PR in N1-N6 either implements one of these
or is out of scope. Disagreements debated here, not later.

### 7.1 Notifications are a triage queue, not a feed.

Read state alone gives operators no way to zero out their inbox.
The 4-state machine (`unread → read → snoozed → done`) gives every
row an obvious lifecycle: see it, decide what to do, act or punt.
Done-count is the meaningful metric, not unread-count.

### 7.2 Every notification answers "why am I seeing this?".

A `reason_text` field is mandatory on every row. Examples:

- Tenant: "You monitor Acme."
- Tenant: "Your team subscribes to the finance sector."
- Super_admin: "Platform alert — operational only."
- Super_admin: "Cross-brand pattern affecting 3 of your tenants."

Without the reason, operators routinely ask "did I configure
this?" and the answer is unclear. With it, every notification is
self-explanatory and the user can mute its source if the reason is
not relevant.

### 7.3 Severity drives routing.

Channel routing (in-app / push / email) is a function of severity,
not of type. The defaults:

- `critical` → in-app + push (time-sensitive) + email; bypasses
  quiet hours when the user opts in.
- `high` → in-app + push.
- `medium` → in-app + email digest.
- `low` → in-app + email digest (opt-in).
- `info` → in-app only; rolled into the daily digest if there is one.

Users override per type in §10's `notification_preferences_v2`.

### 7.4 Subscription model, not broadcast.

Every notification has a target audience expressed as
`audience` + `(brand_id | org_id | user_id)`. The LIST endpoint
joins through `notification_subscriptions` to filter what each
user sees. Tenants only see brands they monitor; super_admins
default to operational-only with an opt-in for the firehose.

### 7.5 Group by entity.

3 changes to Acme within 1h = one expandable inbox row, not 3.
The `group_key` column drives this. Default key: `${type}:${brand_id}`.
Operators chose the time-window (1h, 4h, 24h) per type in §10.

### 7.6 AI intel surfaces only with a "so what".

Raw signals never become notifications; signals with explicit
`recommended_action` framing do. Predictive alerts ("Acme likely
targeted this weekend"), cross-brand patterns ("4 finance tenants
hit critical today"), sector trends, and recommended actions are
all candidates. They land as new types in the `intel_*` family
(§11).

### 7.7 Action buttons on every row.

Every notification surface — bell dropdown, inbox page, push
notification — exposes 1-2 action buttons. Default actions per
severity:

- `critical` / `high`: `Open` + `Snooze 1h`
- `medium` / `low` / `info`: `Open` + `Done`

The `Open` action navigates to `link` + marks the row read in one
operation. Snooze sets `snoozed_until`; Done sets `done_at`. The
row's contextual menu (kebab) adds: Mute this brand / Mute this
type / Snooze longer / Move to digest.

### 7.8 Digest mode for low-severity, realtime for critical.

The default user gets `realtime` for critical+, `daily` digest for
medium+, drops `low` and `info` (opt-in). Power users override per
channel in §10. The digest is a single notification of type
`notification_digest` with bullet entries linking to each
underlying row in the inbox — clicking a digest entry deep-links to
the inbox-filtered view, not just to the source entity.

---

## 8. Decisions log

The operator's answers to the Q1-Q9 sign-off questions, with
rationale and the phase each answer drives.

### Q1. State model — `unread → read → snoozed → done` (4 states). ✅ approved

**Rationale:** matches Linear's triage workflow. Snooze and done as
first-class states are the only way operators can confidently zero
out the inbox; binary read/unread leaves notifications stuck in
"I read it but haven't acted on it" limbo.

**Drives:** N2 schema (`state` column, `snoozed_until`, `done_at`).
N4 UI (4-action button row, snooze picker, done check).

### Q2. Subscription default — Critical+High only by default; configurable. ✅ approved

**Rationale:** new users get a curated stream, not a firehose. They
can opt up to medium/low per brand or globally. Combines
GitHub's "Watching" granularity with PagerDuty's severity-driven
defaults.

**Drives:** N5 default seed for `notification_subscriptions` rows
(level=`default`, severity_floor=`high`). N5 settings UI for
adjustment. N3 backend routing reads the floor.

### Q3. Super_admin firehose — `audience='super_admin'` + `audience='all'` by default with a "show tenant notifications too" opt-in toggle. ✅ approved

**Rationale:** super_admins drown in tenant signal today. Default
should be operational-only (platform health, cross-brand patterns,
critical platform alerts). The opt-in toggle preserves debugging
access without making it the default cognitive load.

**Drives:** N3 LIST endpoint reads
`notification_preferences_v2.show_tenant_notifications`. N5
settings UI exposes the toggle.

### Q4. Email security boundary — boundary-crossing only (D/F→A/B or A/B→D/F). ✅ approved with note: "ready to pivot to per-brand configurable later"

**Rationale:** the screenshot showed "improved" notifications
firing for trivial F→D moves. The boundary policy ensures only
operationally meaningful transitions notify. The "ready to pivot"
note marks per-brand configurability as a Phase N5 follow-up.

**Drives:** N1 cartographer.ts:626 logic change (boundary
detection + dedup metadata + 24h cap). N5 settings — per-brand
"which transitions matter" override (parked under §14 backlog
until N5 lands).

### Q5. AI intel source — static templates for v1; `notification_narrator` sync agent as planned follow-up. ✅ approved

**Rationale:** static templates are predictable, cheap, easy to
tune. AI-generated copy carries hallucination risk on the surface
that operators trust most. The narrator agent is the right tool
for the weekly digest where copy variance is appropriate.

**Drives:** N6 implements static templates per type with variable
slots (what / why_it_matters / recommended_action). Backlog item
**Q5b** scheduled post-N6: build `notification_narrator` sync
agent for the weekly digest.

### Q6. Snooze granularity — per-notification + per-type + per-brand. ✅ approved

**Rationale:** "snooze all Acme notifications for 24h" is the
real-world need during a planned outage or scheduled maintenance
window. Per-type snooze handles "I know about this category, stop
telling me." Per-row is the default action button.

**Drives:** N4 UI (snooze picker on every row + on the kebab menu
+ in the per-brand subscription page). N5 schema —
`notification_subscriptions` already has the structure; just need
`snoozed_until` on subscription rows alongside notification rows.

### Q7. Mobile / push — use existing PWA push (VAPID); add iOS/Android channels. ✅ approved

**Rationale:** the PWA already has VAPID + push wired (see
`packages/trust-radar/src/lib/push.ts`). Channel definitions in
the SW give users OS-native control without us writing native
apps. iOS interruption levels via the W3C
`UNNotificationInterruptionLevel` mapping in §6.6.

**Drives:** N4 (push) — SW channel install, severity-to-level
map, action buttons in `notificationclick`. N5 settings — per-
channel toggles read OS state where possible (Android exposes
channel state via the Notification API).

### Q8. Email channel — realtime for critical+high, daily digest for medium+low; configurable per user. ✅ approved as default

**Rationale:** email is the channel users least want flooded.
Critical+high realtime preserves urgency; everything else rolled
up into a per-day summary that's actionable in one read.

**Drives:** N5
`notification_preferences_v2.email_severity_floor` (default
`high`) and `digest_mode` (default `daily`). N6 implements the
digest renderer.

### Q9. Document first — yes, write `docs/NOTIFICATIONS_AUDIT.md` first. ✅ approved (this document)

**Rationale:** matches `AGENT_AUDIT.md` pattern. Sign-off
artifact reduces churn over the multi-PR sequence. Mid-flight
disagreements are debated against the doc, not against
half-shipped code.

**Drives:** N0 sequence — this doc, built up across small commits
(restart from earlier API-error session because the assembled
single-shot writeup kept timing out).

### Operator-added scope (Q10, post-Q9 input)

> "Also I would consider the Dashboard in Admin as a notification
> component as it emails out a briefing. The email briefing
> hasn't been happening but some of what's in that dashboard
> report might be notification worthy. Like hitting D1 issues,
> Worker issues that can't be fixed by FC, things like that."

**Rationale:** the admin Dashboard surfaces operational signals
that today only reach the operator if they manually visit the
page. Many are notification-worthy (D1 budget approaching skip
threshold, feeds entering at-risk, agents stalled, FC failing to
recover, briefing cron not firing). The broken email briefing is
itself a candidate for a self-monitoring notification ("we
haven't sent a briefing in 36 hours").

**Drives:** New §13 platform-health signals. N6 includes the
email-briefing investigation as a fix, plus the platform-health
notification family.

---

## 9. Phase plan (N0–N6)

Each phase is a coherent unit of work; PRs within a phase chunk
small enough to ship independently. Phase scope can shift — phases
do not.

### N0 — Audit doc (this document)

**Goal:** capture findings, research, principles, decisions, and
implementation plan in one signed-off artifact.

**PRs:** N0a (skeleton + TL;DR) ✓ → N0b (methodology + per-type) ✓
→ N0c (tenant scoping + click + settings) ✓ → N0d-1
(Linear/GitHub/Slack/PagerDuty research) ✓ → N0d-2
(Stripe/iOS/Android/summary) ✓ → N0e (principles + decisions) ✓
→ **N0f (this) (phase plan + schema)** → N0g (AI intel + email
briefing + platform-health) → N0h (backlog + compliance +
changelog).

**Exit criteria:** all 16 sections drafted; operator signs off on
the schema + phase plan before N1 begins.

### N1 — Stop the spam (1 PR)

**Goal:** fix the immediate operator complaint (the screenshot
"Voximplant ×3, MI314 ×3, Pitt ×3"). Quick win that doesn't
require schema changes.

**Deliverables:**
- `cartographer.ts:626` — pass `metadata: { brand_id }` so dedup
  fires; tighten the boundary policy (only D/F→A/B improvements
  and A/B→D/F degradations); cap at 1/brand/24h on top of dedup.
- Add `link: '/brands/${brand.id}'` to email_security_change and
  DMARC notifications.
- Wire click handler in `NotificationBell.tsx` and
  `Notifications.tsx` to `navigate(notification.link)` then
  `markRead`. Skip navigation when `link` is null (graceful).

**Exit criteria:** operator visits live UI; clicks an
email_security_change notification; lands on the brand page.
The same brand doesn't fire the same notification twice within
24h.

### N2 — Schema migration (1 PR)

**Goal:** add the schema fields that every other phase depends on.
Backfill existing rows so the rollout is non-breaking.

**Deliverables:**
- Migration `0127_notifications_v2.sql`: adds `brand_id`,
  `org_id`, `audience`, `state`, `snoozed_until`, `done_at`,
  `reason_text`, `recommended_action`, `group_key` columns to
  `notifications`. Adds `notification_subscriptions` table.
  Adds `notification_preferences_v2` columns or new table (TBD
  in §10). Adds indexes for the new query patterns.
- Backfill: existing rows get `brand_id` populated from
  `metadata.brand_id` JSON when present; `state='read'` for
  rows with `read_at`, `state='unread'` otherwise; `audience`
  defaulted by inspecting `user_id` join to roles.

**Exit criteria:** migration applies cleanly to production; all
existing rows have non-null `state`; LIST endpoint still returns
the same notifications it did before (no regression).

### N3 — Backend routing rewrite (1-2 PRs)

**Goal:** every notification creation routes correctly per its
`audience` + dedup + per-user subscription join. Replaces the
broadcast-to-all-active-users fan-out.

**Deliverables:**
- N3a: `lib/notifications.ts` rewritten. Each type declares
  audience policy + dedup rule + recommended-action template +
  default link generator (registry pattern, like the agent
  registry). `createNotification()` reads the registry and
  routes accordingly. Backward-compatible signature so call
  sites don't all change at once.
- N3b: LIST endpoint joins through `notification_subscriptions`
  for tenant scoping; super_admins respect the
  `show_tenant_notifications` toggle. State-aware filters
  (`?state=unread,snoozed`).
- All 18 existing call sites migrated to pass `metadata` and
  `audience`. Inline TODOs for templates that still need work.

**Exit criteria:** tenant user A sees only brands they monitor;
tenant user B sees only theirs; super_admin sees operational
+ opt-in firehose. No regressions on the 7 currently-working
types.

### N4 — Triage inbox UI redesign (2-3 PRs)

**Goal:** rebuild the notification surfaces around the 4-state
machine, action buttons, and entity grouping.

**Deliverables:**
- N4a: `useNotifications` hook rewrite. Fetch state-grouped
  rows (`unread`, `snoozed`, `done` separated). Mutation hooks
  for each state transition.
- N4b: `<NotificationBell>` rebuild. Inbox-icon style. Action
  buttons on hover. Click navigates `link` + marks read.
  Group-by-entity collapsing.
- N4c: new `/v2/notifications/inbox` page. Linear-style
  primary nav item. Bulk operations. Filter by state, severity,
  type, brand. Empty state for "Inbox zero".
- N4d (push): SW notification channels (iOS/Android), severity
  → interruption level map, action buttons in
  `notificationclick`, `/api/notifications/:id/action` handler.

**Exit criteria:** operator can zero out the inbox; clicking a
notification lands on a useful page; snooze sends a row away
for N hours and brings it back; done is sticky; push
notifications carry inline actions.

### N5 — Subscriptions + preferences (2 PRs)

**Goal:** give users meaningful control. Per-brand watch /
default / ignore. Severity floors. Digest mode.

**Deliverables:**
- N5a: `notification_subscriptions` populated on tenant-brand
  monitoring (auto-create `default` row when a brand is
  monitored). "Watch" button on the brand detail page upgrades
  to `watching`. "Mute" demotes to `ignored`.
  `notification_preferences_v2` populated with sensible
  defaults from §7 / §8.
- N5b: `NotificationPreferences.tsx` rebuilt. Per-channel
  routing matrix (in-app / push / email × type × severity
  floor). Digest mode selector (realtime / hourly / daily /
  weekly). Quiet hours stays. New section: per-brand watch list
  with subscription level controls. Super_admin toggle: "show
  tenant notifications too" (Q3).

**Exit criteria:** a tenant operator can flip a brand to
`watching` and start getting medium+low for it without
touching anything else. A super_admin can flip
`show_tenant_notifications` and start seeing all rows.

### N6 — AI intel + platform-health + email briefing (2-3 PRs)

**Goal:** the new value layer. AI intel surfaces as
notifications; platform-health signals reach the operator;
email briefing fixed + self-monitored.

**Deliverables:**
- N6a (AI intel): new `intel_*` types — `intel_predictive`,
  `intel_cross_brand_pattern`, `intel_sector_trend`,
  `intel_recommended_action`, `intel_threat_actor_surface`.
  Static template per type with variable slots
  (`what` / `why_it_matters` / `recommended_action`). Sources:
  Narrator (briefing), Strategist (campaigns), NEXUS (clusters),
  Curator (hygiene). Each agent emits via the new
  `createNotification()` registry path.
- N6b (platform-health): new `platform_*` types — see §13 for
  the full list (D1 budget warn/skip, feed at-risk, feed
  auto-paused, agent stalled, agent circuit breaker, cron
  orchestrator missed, etc.). All `audience='super_admin'`.
- N6c (email briefing): root-cause fix per §12 investigation.
  Add a self-monitoring `platform_briefing_silent` notification
  that fires if a cron briefing hasn't sent in 36h.

**Exit criteria:** super_admin sees a `platform_d1_budget_warn`
notification when D1 reads cross 85% of daily budget. Tenant
sees an `intel_predictive` notification when NEXUS clusters a
new likely-targeted campaign for one of their brands. The
13:00 UTC briefing email arrives daily.

### Total scope

7 phases, ~12-15 PRs, ~3-4 sessions of work assuming the
chunking pattern from this document continues.

---

## 10. Schema changes

The Phase N2 migration. Three concerns:

1. Existing `notifications` table needs new columns + a wider
   `type` CHECK constraint (to admit `intel_*` and `platform_*`).
2. New `notification_subscriptions` table.
3. New `notification_preferences_v2` table (replaces today's
   flat-toggle structure).

SQLite (D1) cannot `ALTER TABLE … MODIFY CONSTRAINT`. The CHECK
expansion forces a table-recreate. We do it as a single migration
that creates a new table, copies, swaps, drops — same pattern
migration `0107_notifications_schema_check.sql` already used.

### 10.1 `notifications` (recreated)

CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_user ON notification_subscriptions(user_id);

-- Auto-seed: every (user, brand) pair where the user monitors the
-- brand gets a default-level subscription.
INSERT INTO notification_subscriptions (user_id, brand_id, level)
SELECT mb.added_by AS user_id, mb.brand_id, 'default'
FROM monitored_brands mb
WHERE mb.added_by IS NOT NULL
ON CONFLICT (user_id, brand_id) DO NOTHING;
```

The schema treats `default` as "tenant default": user sees critical
+ high (per Q2). `watching` upgrades to all severities. `ignored`
mutes everything for that brand including critical (with a sticky
warning banner in the UI per §6.2).

### 10.3 `notification_preferences_v2` (new)

```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences_v2 (
  user_id                       TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- Severity floors per channel (Q8 + §7.3)
  inapp_severity_floor          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'info'
                                CHECK (inapp_severity_floor IN ('critical','high','medium','low','info')),
  push_severity_floor           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'high'
                                CHECK (push_severity_floor IN ('critical','high','medium','low','info','off')),
  email_severity_floor          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'high'
                                CHECK (email_severity_floor IN ('critical','high','medium','low','info','off')),

  -- Digest mode (Q8 + §7.8)
  digest_mode                   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'daily'
                                CHECK (digest_mode IN ('realtime','hourly','daily','weekly','off')),
  digest_severity_floor         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium'
                                CHECK (digest_severity_floor IN ('high','medium','low','info')),

  -- Quiet hours (preserved from current schema, with critical bypass)
  quiet_hours_start             TEXT,        -- 'HH:MM' or NULL
  quiet_hours_end               TEXT,
  quiet_hours_timezone          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'UTC',
  critical_bypasses_quiet       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,

  -- Super_admin opt-in (Q3)
  show_tenant_notifications     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  updated_at                    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

-- Auto-seed: every active user gets a row with defaults from §7
INSERT INTO notification_preferences_v2 (user_id)
SELECT id FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;
```

The legacy `notification_preferences` table from the current schema
stays in place during N2 (read-only) and gets dropped in N5 once
the rebuilt settings UI ships. This avoids a UI/backend cutover
race.

### 10.4 Per-type subscription overrides — deferred

The schema as written gives per-brand × per-user granularity but
NOT per-type × per-brand. A user who wants "watching for Acme but
mute campaign_escalation specifically" can't express that today.

This is a 4-way join (`user × brand × type × severity_floor`) and
would land in a `notification_type_overrides` table. We park it
in §14 backlog — most users will be satisfied by the per-channel
severity floors + per-brand mute combo.

### 10.5 Indexes (rationale)

| Index | Query it serves | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `idx_notifications_inbox` | LIST endpoint default scan | N3 |
| `idx_notifications_brand` | tenant scoping join | N3 |
| `idx_notifications_audience` | super_admin/all rollups | N3 |
| `idx_notifications_group` | entity-collapse rendering | N4 |
| `idx_notifications_unread` (partial) | bell badge count | N4 |
| `idx_notifications_snoozed` (partial) | snooze-wakeup cron | N4 |
| `idx_subscriptions_user` | per-user subscription list | N5 |

Two partial indexes (`unread`, `snoozed`) keep size small —
`done` rows accumulate but never appear in those indexes.

### 10.6 Migration timing

- **N2 ships** the migration alone. No code changes consume the
  new columns yet — backward-compatible.
- **N3 ships** the backend that writes + reads the new columns.
- **N4 ships** the UI that surfaces the state machine + grouping.
- **N5 ships** the settings UI that writes
  `notification_preferences_v2`.

This ordering means N2 is non-breaking (existing code keeps
working through the rename), N3-N5 build on the schema
incrementally. If any phase needs to be reverted, the schema is
already there for the next attempt.

## 11. AI intel notification opportunities

The platform has Narrator, Observer, Strategist, NEXUS, Curator,
Watchdog, and Sparrow already producing output that today only
reaches `agent_outputs`. None of it reaches the bell. This section
enumerates which signals deserve to become notifications, what they
should look like, and where the source data comes from.

### 11.1 Five new `intel_*` types (Phase N6)

Each is a distinct `type` value in the schema (§10.1). All carry
the standard `(what, why_it_matters, recommended_action)` template
fields per Q5 / §7.6.

#### `intel_predictive`

A near-future targeting prediction based on infrastructure setup
behaviour. NEXUS clusters new lookalike domains on the same ASN as
a previous campaign; Strategist correlates with weekend timing;
together they produce a "likely targeted this weekend" prediction.

- **Source:** `agents/nexus.ts` (cluster detection) +
  `agents/strategist.ts` (campaign correlation)
- **Severity:** high
- **Audience:** tenant (per affected brand) + super_admin (when
  pattern affects ≥2 brands)
- **Trigger:** NEXUS cluster's `predicted_strike_window` field is
  populated AND brand confidence > 0.7
- **Template:**
  - `what`: "We detected 7 new lookalike domains for {brand} on
    AS{asn} — same ASN as last month's campaign."
  - `why_it_matters`: "Infrastructure setup pattern matches
    historical brand-impersonation campaigns. Predicted strike
    window: {window}."
  - `recommended_action`: "Pre-emptively file takedowns for
    flagged domains. Brief support team for likely uptick in
    customer reports."
- **Link:** `/operations/clusters/{cluster_id}`
- **Group key:** `intel_predictive:{brand_id}`

#### `intel_cross_brand_pattern`

Super_admin-only. A pattern affecting multiple tenants in the
same vector — e.g. "same registrar, same TLDs, 4 of your finance
tenants hit critical exposure today."

- **Source:** Observer's daily roll-up + sector aggregation
- **Severity:** critical (when ≥3 tenants in same sector affected)
  / high (when ≥2)
- **Audience:** `super_admin`
- **Trigger:** ≥2 tenants in same sector show new
  `target_brand_id` correlation in the same 24h window
- **Template:**
  - `what`: "{N} tenants in the {sector} sector hit critical
    exposure today (vs {baseline} baseline). Pattern: {dimension}."
  - `why_it_matters`: "This is {fold}× the baseline. Likely
    coordinated campaign. Affected tenants: {list}."
  - `recommended_action`: "Brief affected tenants. Consider
    sector-wide threat-actor attribution. Update default brand
    monitoring rules to flag {pattern}."
- **Link:** `/admin/intel/cross-brand?sector={sector}&window=24h`
- **Group key:** `intel_cross_brand_pattern:{sector}`

#### `intel_sector_trend`

Periodic trend digest scoped to the user's monitored brand sectors.
Tenant-facing version of cross-brand patterns; lower urgency,
longer window (weekly).

- **Source:** Observer's weekly briefing per sector
- **Severity:** medium (low frequency, low urgency)
- **Audience:** tenant (filtered by `monitored_brands → brands.sector`)
- **Trigger:** weekly cron at Mon 06:00 UTC (per-tenant)
- **Template:**
  - `what`: "Phishing volume targeting the {sector} sector is up
    {pct}% this week."
  - `why_it_matters`: "Your monitored brands: {affected_count}
    affected, {unaffected_count} not yet."
  - `recommended_action`: "Review email-security posture for
    unaffected brands. Validate DKIM rotation schedule."
- **Link:** `/intel/sector/{sector}?window=7d`
- **Group key:** `intel_sector_trend:{user_id}:{sector}`

#### `intel_recommended_action`

A standalone "do this thing" notification with a specific
operational recommendation. Curator's hygiene reports + breach
correlations + agent outputs surface here.

- **Source:** Curator (hygiene), agents/observer (correlations),
  brand-detail health checks
- **Severity:** medium (default) / high (when tied to active
  campaign or recent breach)
- **Audience:** tenant (per affected brand)
- **Trigger:** any of: DKIM key > 2 years old, DMARC policy still
  `none`, BIMI record missing on brand with strong
  email-security grade, recent breach in sector
- **Template:**
  - `what`: "Your DKIM key on {domain} is {age} old."
  - `why_it_matters`: "We detected a similar pattern in 2 recent
    breaches in the {sector} sector. Long-lived keys are higher
    risk for compromise."
  - `recommended_action`: "Schedule DKIM rotation this quarter.
    Documentation: {link}."
- **Link:** `/brands/{brand_id}/email-security`
- **Group key:** `intel_recommended_action:{brand_id}:{check_id}`

#### `intel_threat_actor_surface`

Threat-actor-centric. Surfaces when a tracked actor expands
infrastructure that targets brands the user monitors.

- **Source:** `threat_actors` + `threat_actor_infrastructure`
  (NEXUS adds new IPs to known actors)
- **Severity:** high (if user has been targeted before by this
  actor) / medium (if active in user's sector but no prior
  targeting)
- **Audience:** tenant
- **Trigger:** new row in `threat_actor_infrastructure` for an
  actor where `threat_actor_targets.brand_id ∈ user_monitored`
- **Template:**
  - `what`: "Threat actor **{actor_name}** added {count} new IPs
    to their infrastructure today."
  - `why_it_matters`: "This actor previously targeted {brand_list}
    in {prior_window}. Active in your sector."
  - `recommended_action`: "Add new IPs to block list. Review
    detection rules for {actor_name}'s known TTPs."
- **Link:** `/threat-actors/{actor_slug}`
- **Group key:** `intel_threat_actor_surface:{actor_slug}:{user_id}`

### 11.2 Routing matrix

How each `intel_*` type routes by audience + severity + default
channel:

| Type | Audience | Default severity | Default channels (per §7.3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intel_predictive` | tenant | high | in-app + push |
| `intel_predictive` (≥2 brands) | super_admin | critical | in-app + push + email |
| `intel_cross_brand_pattern` | super_admin | critical/high | in-app + push + email |
| `intel_sector_trend` | tenant | medium | in-app + daily digest |
| `intel_recommended_action` | tenant | medium/high | in-app + (push if high) + daily digest |
| `intel_threat_actor_surface` | tenant | medium/high | in-app + (push if user previously targeted) |

### 11.3 Why these and not others

The existing agents produce dozens of agent_outputs entries per
day. Most don't deserve to be notifications — they're either:

- Internal supervision signals (FC's per-tick reports → already
  handled via §13 platform-health for super_admin only)
- Per-threat classifications (Sentinel/Analyst — too high frequency
  for a notification surface; the bell would drown)
- Routine enrichment (Cartographer's ASN/geo — the fact of
  enrichment is uninteresting)

The five `intel_*` types above are specifically chosen because:

1. They have a **clear "so what"** (Q5 + §7.6).
2. They have a **specific recommended action** the user can take.
3. They're **rare enough** (per-brand or per-sector, not per-
   threat) that the bell stays useful.
4. They **link to a useful destination** (cluster page, sector
   page, brand page, threat-actor profile) that already exists.

### 11.4 Q5b — narrator agent for the weekly digest (parked)

The static templates above work for v1. The Q5b follow-up adds a
`notification_narrator` sync agent that takes a digest period
(week / month) + the user's affected brands + the period's intel
events and produces a single AI-summarised digest. This is
appropriate for the digest because:

- Digest copy is read once per period; variance is welcome.
- The summarisation is tightly bounded (input is structured;
  output is narrative).
- Hallucination risk is low because every claim links back to a
  specific underlying notification row.

Out of scope for N6. Schema in §10 already supports it (the
`notification_digest` envelope type + `metadata.digest_window`).

## 12. Email briefing investigation

The user's Q10 expanded scope to include the **broken email
briefing**: dispatched daily at hour 13 from the orchestrator,
but recipients report inconsistent delivery and stale content.
This section documents what we found in the dispatch path and
what N6c will fix.

### 12.1 Dispatch path

```
orchestrator (hour===13)
  → handlers/briefing.ts: sendDailyBriefingEmails()
  → lib/briefing-email.ts: buildBriefingForUser() per active user
  → lib/email.ts: sendEmail() via Resend
```

Key files:
- `packages/trust-radar/src/handlers/briefing.ts` — entry, dedup
  against same-day cron briefings
- `packages/trust-radar/src/lib/briefing-email.ts:555` — content
  assembly; this is where stale/empty briefings originate
- `packages/trust-radar/src/lib/email.ts` — Resend wrapper

### 12.2 Failure modes observed

| # | Symptom | Suspected cause |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Email sent but body shows "no events in window" when there clearly were | Window math uses `now - 24h` against `created_at`, but feeds run on hour-aligned cycles → a tick at 13:07 misses the 13:00 ingestion that hasn't completed yet |
| 2 | Same brand listed 5× in one email | No `GROUP BY brand_id` in the digest assembly query — one row per threat |
| 3 | Recipients on inactive orgs still get email | User-status filter exists, but org-status filter doesn't |
| 4 | "Top threat" section empty | Severity filter requires `severity IN ('critical','high')` but the assembly query doesn't pre-filter, so `LIMIT 5` returns 5 info-level rows |
| 5 | Email never arrives | Resend rate-limit on shared domain; no retry; failure is logged to `agent_runs.error_message` but no surface in the UI |

### 12.3 Decision — fold briefing into notifications

Rather than fixing the email briefing as a standalone feature,
N6c collapses it into the notifications system:

1. Daily briefing becomes a **`notification_digest` envelope row**
   (audience=`tenant`, severity=`info`) created at hour 13.
2. The envelope's `metadata.digest_window` is `'24h'` and
   `metadata.notification_ids[]` lists the underlying rows.
3. Email is sent **only if** the user has
   `notification_preferences_v2.channel_email = true` AND
   `digest_mode = 'daily'` (per Q8 default).
4. Users who chose `digest_mode = 'realtime'` get the per-event
   emails as they happen, not a digest.
5. Users who chose `channel_email = false` still see the digest
   in the bell — no email.

This kills the bespoke briefing path entirely. The schema in §10
already covers it.

### 12.4 N6c diagnostic checks (pre-merge)

Before shipping N6c, run on a staging copy:

```sql
-- 1. Are there users whose org is inactive but who'd still receive?
SELECT u.id, u.email, o.status
FROM users u
JOIN org_members om ON om.user_id = u.id
JOIN organizations o ON o.id = om.org_id
WHERE u.status = 'active' AND o.status != 'active';

-- 2. How many digest rows would today's run produce?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS recipients,
       COUNT(*) AS notification_rows
FROM notifications
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now','-24 hours')
  AND audience = 'tenant';

-- 3. Resend log: how many bounces/failures in last 7 days?
SELECT date(created_at) AS day,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status='failed') AS failed,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status='delivered') AS delivered
FROM email_log
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now','-7 days')
GROUP BY day;
```

If row 3's `failed` is non-trivial, raise the SPF/DKIM warning
to the team before flipping the digest flag.
