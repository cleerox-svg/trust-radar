## PRIORITY BUILD ORDER (to make public claims truthful)

The corporate site describes all these features. Before going live, the minimum set to back up the claims:

### MUST HAVE before site launch:
1. Landing page built in Worker (from prototype)
2. Free Brand Exposure Report (/scan) — even if some sub-components are simplified
3. Brand Exposure Score computation (even simplified weighting)
4. Lookalike domain generation (basic permutations + DNS check)
5. Social handle checking (basic exists/doesn't-exist per platform)
6. Public corporate site pages (at minimum: landing, platform, pricing, about, contact, security)
7. Privacy policy + Terms of service (legal requirement)
8. Theme toggle (light/dark)

### SHOULD HAVE within weeks of launch:
9. Social monitoring cron + impersonation scoring
10. AI threat narratives (Analyst agent prompt for multi-signal correlation)
11. Credential breach integration
12. CT log monitoring
13. Email notifications/alerts
14. Historical grade tracking
15. Blog (first 3 posts)
16. Documentation (getting started + API basics)

### CAN FOLLOW after launch:
17. STIX 2.1 export
18. Webhook system
19. Connected mode (email gateway integration)
20. Changelog
21. Observer briefing enhancements
22. Subscription billing
23. Enterprise features (multi-tenant, SSO)
