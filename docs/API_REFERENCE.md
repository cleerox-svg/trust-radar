## App Store Impersonation Monitoring

iOS App Store impersonation scanner (Google Play + 3rd-party Android
stores planned). Findings are upserted into `app_store_listings` and
classified rule-based first; ambiguous rows are re-assessed by Haiku.
HIGH/CRITICAL impersonation findings create `alerts` rows of type
`app_store_impersonation` and fire an `alert.created` webhook.

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/appstore/monitor/:brandId` | User | List app-store listings + schedule for a brand. Filters: `store`, `classification`, `severity`, `status`, `limit`, `offset`. |
| POST | `/api/appstore/scan/:brandId` | User | Trigger an immediate iOS scan + AI drain for this brand. |
| PATCH | `/api/appstore/:id` | User | Update a listing's `classification` or `status` (manual override, wins over AI/system). |
| PATCH | `/api/brands/:brandId/official-apps` | User | Replace the brand's `official_apps` allowlist. Matching existing rows auto-flip to `classification='official'`. |

**Takedown integration:** App-store findings can be escalated by creating
a takedown with `target_type='mobile_app'` and `target_platform='ios_app_store'`
or `'google_play_store'`. When `source_type='app_store_listing'` and
`source_id` is a listing UUID, severity and evidence are auto-filled.

## Dark-Web Mention Monitoring

Paste-archive mention scanner (PSBDMP initially; Telegram, HIBP, Flare,
and DarkOwl land in future slices via the `source` column without schema
changes). Per-brand scanner fans out watch terms (brand name, aliases,
domain, executive names from `brands.executive_names`) against the paste
archive, fetches candidate bodies, and classifies each. Threat-actor
aliases from the `threat_actors` table are cross-referenced as a
severity boost. HIGH/CRITICAL confirmed findings create `alerts` rows
of type `dark_web_mention` and fire an `alert.created` webhook.

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/darkweb/overview` | User | Cross-brand dashboard: one row per monitored brand with severity-bucketed counts and schedule info. Admin scope sees all; tenant scope sees `monitored_brands.added_by = :userId`. |
| GET | `/api/darkweb/mentions/:brandId` | User | List mentions + schedule for a brand. Filters: `source`, `classification`, `severity`, `match_type`, `status`, `limit`, `offset`. |
| POST | `/api/darkweb/scan/:brandId` | User | Trigger an immediate scan + AI drain for this brand. |
| PATCH | `/api/darkweb/:id` | User | Update a mention's `classification` or `status` (manual override, wins over AI/system). |

**Classification values:** `confirmed`, `suspicious`, `false_positive`, `resolved`, `unknown`.
**Status values:** `active`, `resolved`, `false_positive`, `investigating`.
**Match types:** `brand_name`, `domain`, `executive`, `actor_alias`, `mixed`.
